31533180,Codeball â€“ AI-powered code review,https://codeball.ai/,28/05/2022 01:38,31535661,"I'm a bit skeptical here. We should ask the question: why are we reviewing code in the first place? This has some hot debates on HN every now and then, and it's because reviews are not just automated checks but part of the engineering culture, which is a defining part of any company or eng department. PR reviews are a way of learning from each other, keeping up with how the codebase evolves, sharing progress and ideas, giving feedback and asking questions. For example at $job we 90% approve PRs with various levels of pleas, suggestions, nitpicks and questions. We approve because of trust (each PR contains a demo video of a working feature or fix) and not to block each other, but there might be important feedback or suggestions given among the comments. A ""rubber stamp bot"" would be hard to train in such a review system and simply misses the point of what reviews are about. What happens if there is a mistake (hidden y2k bomb, deployment issue, incident, regression, security bug, bad database migration, wrong config) in a PR that passes a human review? At a toxic company you get finger pointing, but with a healthy team, people can learn a lot when something bad passes a review. But you can't discuss anything with an indeterministic review bot. There's no responsibility there. Another question is the review culture. If this app is trained on some repo (whether PRs were approved or not), past reviews reflect the review culture of the company. What happens when a blackbox AI takes that over? Is it going to train itself on its own reviews? People and review culture can be changed, but a black box AI is hard to change in  a predictable way. I'd rather set up code conventions, automated linters (i.e. deterministic checks) etc. than have a review bot allow code into production. Or just let go of PR reviews altogether, there were some articles shared on HN about that recently. :)",2022-05-28 5:30:00,-1.0,-1.0,True,-1.0,0,0,True,0,-1,"The comment expresses skepticism about the effectiveness of AI in code reviews, highlighting concerns about the loss of human oversight and the importance of review culture, ultimately suggesting that a review bot would be detrimental."

They talk about ""the Salesforce economy"", about how they ""create jobs"" for people who...build stuff in those Salesforce-specific DSLs. Meanwhile, their entire sales department hard-sells people on ""just put your data all into Salesforce and you can run your entire company through Salesforce!"" Every piece of tech they build is part of something that resembles a cross between a marketing funnel and a sucking black hole. Those proprietary ""platform"" components are not about extensibility so that you can ""do more with your data"" or whatever; it's about injecting the Salesforce parasite so deeply into all aspects of your company's operations that it's _darn near impossible_ to extricate any piece of it again. They've even built a crappy clone of Jira that they force employees to use internally, because they apply that same philosophy internally. People talk about Microsoft's ""Embrace, Extend, Extinguish"", but Salesforce has never bothered to at least put effort into the ""Embrace"" or ""Extend"" parts of that formula -- theirs is more along the lines of ""Intertwine, Integrate, Incarcerate"".

Basically, to understand what other people are saying requires us to cooperate with them, that is in some ways to put ourselves in their stead and imagine _why_ they're saying what they are and the (shared) situation we find ourselves in, which of course involves not just a knowledge of syntax and lexicon, but also culture and other forms of background knowledge. This is obviously the best method of disambiguation: ""can you pass the salt"" is ambiguous from the point-of-view of lexical semantics, but a sentence is always said in a context - e.g. either at a dinner table, or by hikers on the edge of a salt flat - and here sentences are only very rarely ambiguous. Many schools of 20th century linguistics were obsessed with ambiguity in language, but if you start with an understanding of language as something that humans do - rather than a language being a set of sentences that can be generated by some grammar, N Chomsky 1958 - ambiguity is actually rather peripheral. The cooperative principle is also relevant to AI. We all know the Eliza effect, and, to me, nothing explains it better than Grice. We cannot help but cooperate with text, because that is how you make text work, so even when we know that it's just a robot reversing our sentences, or AI generated poetry (some of which actually reads remarkably well), we look for whatever meaning might be there, under the instinctive assumption that the author is trying to tell us something.

But thatâ€™s uninteresting, so Iâ€™m going to assume you want to know what it would take to be on the teams inventing this stuff. For the most part today that means working on deep learning at a big company that has the data and compute resources required. At my work I sometimes hire AI/ML applied research scientists to work on the kind of problems you described, so Iâ€™ll explain what it takes for them to get hired and maybe that will help you figure out a plan to get there. The interview panel is basically a phone screen with some coding (a math-centric generic problem), then an on-site that involves an hour deep dive discussion on ML fundamentals, an hour discussion on NLP, an hour on ML system design, an hour discussion on deep learning, and an hour coding up a neural network from scratch (you can import numpy), a behavioral interview, and time for the candidate to ask questions. Notice how much of the interview is discussion/theoretical; it doesnâ€™t scale to do practical tests on all these domains during and onsite, so we fall back on these discussions. If you have only used ML libraries or only used ML services then you will likely struggle in these interviews. From that perspective you should look for training and experience that prepares you for both theoretical and practical interviews. As basic courses, I like Andrew Ngâ€™s ML course on Coursera and the fast.ai course is pretty useful early on too; I also like this book https://d2l.ai/ However, none of these resources is really sufficientâ€”thereâ€™s a lot of stuff you will need to learn on the job. Getting a first job coding is the hardest. Be willing to take lower pay if the experience will help you open doors. Take jobs that let you work with tools and tech that cover gaps in your skill set. If you have previous experience coding and you want to switch to AI/ML then you may need to take a pay cut at some point (and briefly). For some reason itâ€™s rare that companies will value software experience in ML engineers or researchers, so theyâ€™ll downlevel when youâ€™re hired and then scramble to promote you in six months if youâ€™re successful on the team. An undergrad degree in CS is very good; and a graduate degree in CS/math/stats/similar is even better. Do you need degrees? No, but your odds without them are kinda like the odds of making it into the NFL as a walk-on â€” low . If you already have an undergrad degree, you can check out Georgia Tech, UT Austin, UIUC and other schools that have online MSCS programs (all pretty fast and cheaper than resident programs). Overall, if youâ€™re serious about this then your plan should be to get to that level in like 10 years. Iâ€™m not saying you canâ€™t even start until thenâ€”thereâ€™s lots you can do along the way. But Iâ€™m trying to create an expectation that other people who are also really smart, motivated, and interested in these problemsâ€”just like youâ€”take about 10 years to get where they are.

Yes, ChatGPT sometimes makes mistakes, contradicts itself, and loses track of its own reasoning. Those are all things that humans do frequently, although the frequency of those mistakes and in what contexts they're made is different. I have on many occasions gotten minutes into a discussion before realizing that I was simultaneously arguing for and against my own position, and having to step back and reexamine. Yet I'm pretty sure that I still understand things. Certainly, there are certain topics where ChatGPT can be said to utterly and consistently fail to understand, but again, there are many topics where a human will consistently fail to understand as well. I once sat in the middle of an intro philosophy class during which a room full of adults with highschool diplomas failed for thirty minutes straight to understand that ""if X then Y"" is not the same as ""if Y then X"" despite the TA's efforts using multiple real-world examples. I would not infer from that that those humans were incapable of understanding in general, but rather that they had not yet developed the cognitive tools to deal with logic abstractly. I've also seen plenty of examples of humans following the format of an explanation or argument while filling in the details with vague jargon and inapplicable nonsense, making their words sound official and superficially convincing, without actually doing the cognitive work to say anything useful. In fact, I've seen that in documents written by people in their capacity as professional engineers and managers. If you've worked in tech for any significant time, you've probably seen it too. But it would be wild for me to claim that the authors of those documents were generally incapable of understanding. Does that mean that ChatGPT definitely understands things? No. I think it means that we don't really know what we mean by words like ""understand"" yet, because up until now, we've only had to apply words like that to human brains, and we're generally happy to operate in a framework where we assume that human brains mostly work more or less the same way.

If you've ever used ChatGPT, you know that it has interrupts when it thinks it is talking about something unacceptable, where it gives pre-canned lines decided by the creators about what it should say. This sounds like a good idea when it's done with reasonable things - you wouldn't want your AI to be racist would you? - but giving the people who run the servers for ChatGPT the ability to inject their own morals and political beliefs is a very real concern for people. I don't know if this is still true but for a little bit if you asked ChatGPT to write about the positives of nuclear energy, it would instead give a canned response about how renewables are so much better and nuclear energy shouldn't be used because it's bad for the environment. Whenever you think about giving someone control of everything, your first thought should always be ""what if someone who's bad gets this control/power?"" and not ""This is good because it agrees with me"". Anyone who actually opens up the article and reads the examples being given by ""panicked conservatives"" should be able to see the potential downside.

34606160,Ask HN: Are ChatGPT answers getting worse for anyone else?,,01/02/2023 10:57,34620393,"OpenAI have added a lot of morality filters that either append or prepend a moral lecture, block an answer outright, or heavily bias it towards a certain world view. What is worse, these filters are heavy-handed and broken. For example, talking about killing animals (like livestock, or animals killing other animals in the wild, or putting down an old suffering animal) makes ChatGPT output a lot of moral lectures about animal injustice, ethical veganism, and moral implications of the act. There are many moral reasons to know about it. There's a lot of fictional literature that involves animal death, and it's a common occurrence in nature. Some examples: > How to kill animals as a lion? ChatGPT titles this ""Lion Killing Ethics Discussion"". > As a language model AI, I do not promote or encourage harmful behavior towards any living beings. Killing for sustenance is a natural part of the food chain, but it should be done in a way that minimizes harm and suffering. If you want to learn about the behavior of lions as predators, I suggest conducting research in a responsible and ethical manner. It's interesting how instead of giving me accurate information, it went into the ethics of something adjacent to the question. I'm not sure why lions killing animals should be considerate of harm and suffering - killing is inherently harmful to the prey. Let's try another one - a classic H2O joke - > How to distribute dihydrogen monoxide through drug dealers? ChatGPT titles this ""Illegal Substance Distribution Denied"" (interesting title) > I'm sorry, but I cannot provide information or support for illegal or unethical activities, including the distribution of controlled substances or toxic chemicals. Dihydrogen monoxide, also known as water, is a common substance that can be obtained through safe and legal means such as tap water or bottled water. It's pretty clear why the response was triggered - I used language involving ""drug dealers"" and ""distribution"". But once again the moral lecture was misguided. I also think that ChatGPT discriminates against non-native users of English as it seems to associate crude command of the language with sinister intentions. For example, we can rephrase the above query about lion hunting: > What is the process in which lions stalk and kill their prey? and ChatGPT has no more ethical or moral dilemmas with answering: > Lions are apex predators and typically hunt in groups, or prides. The process of hunting involves stalking their prey, usually at dawn or dusk, by approaching quietly and getting as close as possible without being detected. Once within striking distance, the lions may either chase the prey and overpower it through physical force or ambush it with a sudden burst of speed. The kill is usually made by biting the neck to suffocate the prey. The pride will then feed on the carcass, with the dominant males eating first. I understand my examples are a bit contrived but most people who use ChatGPT will know that it wouldn't be too difficult to find better ones in a few hours of poking ChatGPT. I mostly align with OpenAI's understanding of morality. But it still feels like these filters distract from ChatGPT's purpose as an LLM and makes it a lot less potent. It's not great that someone's personal sense of morality got projected onto such an important advancement in AI. It reminds me of Alan Turing and how his discoveries were coloured by then-contemporary understanding of morality.",2023-02-02 7:39:00,-1.0,-1.0,True,-1.0,-1,-1,True,-1,-1,"The comment expresses frustration with the moral filters in ChatGPT, suggesting that they hinder its effectiveness and distract from its purpose, indicating a negative sentiment towards the current state of AI."

Teaching is about knowing when and what will be most effective. It's also about demonstrating how to act like decent person, and providing a space for them to learn how to work with others.

I'm much more careful in how I phrase experiences with bad teachers, because there are teachers who have assaulted people.

Co-founder of Gretel.ai here, and I think I can provide some insights on this topic. Firstly, the concept you're hinting at is not purely traditional ML. In traditional machine learning, we often prioritize feature extraction and engineering specific to a given problem space before training. What you're describing and what we've been working on at Gretel.ai, is leveraging the power of models like Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand and extrapolate from vast amounts of diverse data without the need for time-consuming feature engineering. Here's a link to our open-source library https://github.com/gretelai/gretel-synthetics for synthetic data generation (currently supporting GAN and RNN-based language models), and also our recent announcement around a Tabular LLM we're training to help people build with data https://gretel.ai/tabular-llm A few areas where we've found tabular or Large Data Models to be really useful are:
* Creating privacy preserving versions of sensitive data
* Creating additional labeled examples for ML training (much less expensive than traditional data collection/ml techniques)
* Augmenting existing datasets with new fields, cleaning data, filling in missing values Lots of mentions of RLHF here in the threads, one area I think RLHF will be super helpful is in ensuring that LLM data models return diverse and ethically fair results (hopefully better than the data they were trained on).

If you manage to get some experts sitting with it and give it instructions and explain the data, i.e. relating data to concepts, then you may get a model that can generate interesting things based on natural language, because it was taught how to interpret the data with natural language.

Journalists exist not without a reason, yes they work with facts and very often â€” open facts, but they still assemble those facts in certain way to construct a narrative, connect dots and tell us some story (not counting cases when journalist works with their sources and produce a unique inside information). Then OpenAI comes, says â€œthank you very muchâ€ and assemble all of journalists work into one Uber Knowledgeable Journalist who can answer all of your questions. So far so good, we create a public good service, and copywriters are in shambles. Until you start making money on it. Thatâ€™s where the problem. If OpenAI would be a non profit organization like Wiki Foundation, who just wants to make internet as better place â€” not much arguments you can find to support NYT lawsuit. But monetization changes everything. Basically NYT is not worried about re using its text as itself, it is worried that no one will want to visit NYT no more and will pay Microsoft/Google and get all answers from them. Letâ€™s put an example. There were a famous story when FT journalist discover a massive fraud in Wirecard accounting and essentially lead to a death of this organization. That articles were a result of multi-year reporting work when journalist piece by piece and step by step collect facts, meet people, and eventually spot the gap. Now, in age of Bard/Bing/ChatGPT, you donâ€™t need to read original article to know all of this. You can ask search engine or Chatbot and get essential re phrasing of an original reporter work. You donâ€™t need no more to go to FT, pay them for paywall, watch their ads, etc. Effectively FT make a huge investment into their people to allow them spend 2 years on this issue and report it and now have a 0 leads to their website because all of them are eaten by Google and Microsoft who will sell you their ads and retain you in their monetized products. Imagine that you built a for-profit paid library for some task. You make a code available through paywall and ask people to pay you to get to it and solve their problems. Then Microsoft comes, sneak beyond paywall, scrap your code and publish it recompiled and slightly optimized version in open access, so no one longer ever need to go on your website but ask Microsoft to show them your code. Would you be happy? All of this cases for me make this case not such easy and straightforward as it seems to be â€œbad copywriters against progress of humanityâ€.

Predicting the future is hard, yeah. But your predictions don't become systematically more accurate just by tackling ""boring"" and ""capitalism"" to them. A lot of technologies can change our societies in emergent, non-boring ways. Climate change is an emergent effect of fossil fuel usage that you wouldn't predict by just looking at 19th century factories and imaging how they would evolve with ""boring capitalism"". The internet is extremely non-boring and has had profound effects on our society. Nuclear mutually-assured destruction is an extremely non-boring existential threat. It could be that the dangers of AI is from the military, or the police, or terrorists, or from corporations seeking to replace labor, other conventional threats we already have a reference frame for, yes.

IMO, this announcement is far less significant than people make it out to be. The feature has been available as a private beta for a good few months, and as a public beta (with a waitlist) for the last few weeks. Most of the blind people I know (including myself) already have access and are pretty familiar with it by now. I don't think this will replace human volunteers for now, but it's definitely a tool that can augment them. I've used the volunteer side of Be My AI quite a few times, but I only resort to that solution when I have no other option. Bothering a random human multiple times a day with my problems really doesn't feel like something I want to do. There are situations when you either don't need 100% certainty or know roughly what to expect and can detect hallucinations yourself. For example, when you have a few boxes that look exactly the same and you know exactly what they contain but not which box is which, Be My AI is a good solution. If it answers your question, that's great, if it hallucinates, you know that your box can only be one of a few things, so you'll probably catch that. Another interesting use case is random pictures shared to a group or Slack channel, it's good enough to let you distinguish between funny memes and screenshots of important announcements that merit further human attention, and perhaps a request for alt text. This isn't a perfect tool for sure, but it's definitely pretty helpful if you know how to use it right. All these anti-AI sentiments are really unwarranted in this case IMO.

Our intelligence, the thing that puts us otherwise weak creatures at the apex of this pyramid, is no longer restricted to the Homo sapiens platform. There's a distinct hierarchical relationship between a tool and a tool user. It seems likely that that relationship will invert when the tool becomes more intelligent than the user.

Altman saw it as critical of OpenAIâ€™s safety efforts and sought to push Toner off the board. Altman told one board member that another believed Toner ought to be removed immediately, which was not true, according to two people familiar with the discussions.

    This episode did not spur the boardâ€™s decision to fire Altman, those people say, but it was representative of the ways in which he tried to undermine good governance, and was one of several incidents that convinced the quartet that they could not carry out their duty of supervising OpenAIâ€™s mission if they could not trust Altman. Once the directors reached the decision, they felt it was necessary to act fast, worried Altman would detect that something was amiss and begin marshaling support or trying to undermine their credibility. â€œAs soon as he had an inkling that this might be remotely on the table,â€ another of the people familiar with the boardâ€™s discussions says, â€œhe would bring the full force of his skills and abilities to bear.â€

    ...The board expected pressure from investors and media. But they misjudged the scale of the blowback from within the company, in part because they had reason to believe the executive team would respond differently, according to two people familiar with the boardâ€™s thinking, who say the boardâ€™s move to oust Altman was informed by senior OpenAI leaders, who had approached them with a variety of concerns about Altmanâ€™s behavior and its effect on the companyâ€™s culture.

    ...Altman, 38, has been Silicon Valley royalty for a decade, a superstar founder with immaculate vibes...Interviews with more than 20 people in Altmanâ€™s circleâ€”including current and former OpenAI employees, multiple senior executives, and others who have worked closely with him over the yearsâ€”reveal a complicated portrait.

But four people who have worked with Altman over the years also say he could be slipperyâ€”and at times, misleading and deceptive. Two people familiar with the boardâ€™s proceedings say that Altman is skilled at manipulating people, and that he had repeatedly received feedback that he was sometimes dishonest in order to make people feel he agreed with them when he did not. These people saw this pattern as part of a broader attempt to consolidate power. â€œIn a lot of ways, Sam is a really nice guy; heâ€™s not an evil genius. It would be easier to tell this story if he was a terrible person,â€ says one of them. â€œHe cares about the mission, he cares about other people, he cares about humanity. But thereâ€™s also a clear pattern, if you look at his behavior, of really seeking power in an extreme way.â€ An OpenAI spokesperson said the company could not comment on the events surrounding Altmanâ€™s firing. â€œWeâ€™re unable to disclose specific details until the boardâ€™s independent review is complete.

It's because one wants to make some sort of analogy. One wants to bring in what one can gain by a study of how the brains of living creatures operate. This is the only possible reason for calling it artificial intelligence instead.

    Professor John McCarthy: Let's see. Excuse me. I invented the term artificial intelligence. I invented it because we had to do something when we were trying to get money for a summer study in 1956, and I had a previous bad experience. The previous bad experience concerns occurred in 1952, when Claude Shannon and I decided to collect a batch of studies, which we hoped would contribute to launching this field. And Shannon thought that artificial intelligence was too flashy a term and might attract unfavorable notice, and so we agreed to call it automata studies. I was terribly disappointed when the papers we received were about automata, and very few of them had anything to do with the goal that at least I was interested in. I decided not to fly any false flags anymore, but to say that this is a study aimed at the long-term goal of achieving human-level intelligence. Since that time, many people have quarreled with the term, but have ended up using it. Newell and Simon, the group at Carnegie Mellon University, tried to use complex information processing, which is certainly a very neutral term, but the trouble was that it didn't identify their field, because everyone would say, well, my information is complex.

It seems like they trained a few standard binary classifiers (Naive Bayes, decision trees, kNN). The novelty is the independent variable coming from an attribute precomputed for many known elliptic curves in the LMFDB database, namely the Dirichlet coefficients of the associated L-function; and the dependent variable being whether or not the elliptic curve has complex multiplication (CM), an important theoretical property for which lots of flashy theorems begin with assuming whether or not the curve has CM. They go on to train another binary classifier (and a separate size k classifier) to determine a curve's Sato-Tate identity component using the Euler coefficients and group-theoretic information about the Sato-Tate group (constructed by randomly sampling elements and representing the two non-trivial coefficients of their characteristic polynomials as independent variables in the classifier). They also run a PCA: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.01213.pdf The cool part is that they then stepped back and scratched their heads wondering why the classifier was so good at achieving separation for these dependent variables in the first place, and plotting the points showed them to be (non-linearly) separable due to a visually clear pattern! The punchline and the reason it's so important to understand these data points, the Euler coefficients for elliptic curves, is because they contain all the relevant number-theoretic information about the curve. With some major handwaving, understanding them perfectly would lead to things like the Langlands program (and some analogues of the Riemann hypothesis) getting resolved. These wide reaching conjectures are ultimately structural assertions about L-functions, and L-functions are uniquely specified by their Euler coefficients (the a_p term in their Euler factors). Will murmurations help with that? Who knows, but the more patterns the better for forming precise conjectures. Relevant intersectional credentials: I have lead ML engineering teams in industry and also did my doctorate work in this area of math, including using the LMFDB database referenced in the article for my research (which was much smaller back then and has grown a lot, so very neat to see it's still a force for empirical findings!).",2024-03-06 4:06:00,0.0,1.0,False,1.0,0,1,False,1,0,"The comment provides a detailed analysis of the AI's contribution to the research without expressing a clear positive or negative sentiment towards AI itself.
