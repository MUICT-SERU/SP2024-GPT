31533180,Codeball â€“ AI-powered code review,https://codeball.ai/,28/05/2022 01:38,31535661,"I'm a bit skeptical here. We should ask the question: why are we reviewing code in the first place? This has some hot debates on HN every now and then, and it's because reviews are not just automated checks but part of the engineering culture, which is a defining part of any company or eng department. PR reviews are a way of learning from each other, keeping up with how the codebase evolves, sharing progress and ideas, giving feedback and asking questions. For example at $job we 90% approve PRs with various levels of pleas, suggestions, nitpicks and questions. We approve because of trust (each PR contains a demo video of a working feature or fix) and not to block each other, but there might be important feedback or suggestions given among the comments. A ""rubber stamp bot"" would be hard to train in such a review system and simply misses the point of what reviews are about. What happens if there is a mistake (hidden y2k bomb, deployment issue, incident, regression, security bug, bad database migration, wrong config) in a PR that passes a human review? At a toxic company you get finger pointing, but with a healthy team, people can learn a lot when something bad passes a review. But you can't discuss anything with an indeterministic review bot. There's no responsibility there. Another question is the review culture. If this app is trained on some repo (whether PRs were approved or not), past reviews reflect the review culture of the company. What happens when a blackbox AI takes that over? Is it going to train itself on its own reviews? People and review culture can be changed, but a black box AI is hard to change in  a predictable way. I'd rather set up code conventions, automated linters (i.e. deterministic checks) etc. than have a review bot allow code into production. Or just let go of PR reviews altogether, there were some articles shared on HN about that recently. :)",2022-05-28 05:30,0,0,True,0

Salesforce is _explicitly_ geared towards vendor lock-in -- it's their bread and butter. It's why they have a vendor-specific clone of React (Lightning Web Components), a bad vendor-specific clone of Java (Apex), a bad vendor-specific clone of SQL, and a faux-development ecosystem that requires you to use their bespoke custom tools and their bespoke custom languages and frameworks. They talk about ""the Salesforce economy"", about how they ""create jobs"" for people who...build stuff in those Salesforce-specific DSLs. Meanwhile, their entire sales department hard-sells people on ""just put your data all into Salesforce and you can run your entire company through Salesforce!"" Every piece of tech they build is part of something that resembles a cross between a marketing funnel and a sucking black hole. Those proprietary ""platform"" components are not about extensibility so that you can ""do more with your data"" or whatever; it's about injecting the Salesforce parasite so deeply into all aspects of your company's operations that it's _darn near impossible_ to extricate any piece of it again. They've even built a crappy clone of Jira that they force employees to use internally, because they apply that same philosophy internally. People talk about Microsoft's ""Embrace, Extend, Extinguish"", but Salesforce has never bothered to at least put effort into the ""Embrace"" or ""Extend"" parts of that formula -- theirs is more along the lines of ""Intertwine, Integrate, Incarcerate"".

Basically, to understand what other people are saying requires us to cooperate with them, that is in some ways to put ourselves in their stead and imagine _why_ they're saying what they are and the (shared) situation we find ourselves in, which of course involves not just a knowledge of syntax and lexicon, but also culture and other forms of background knowledge. This is obviously the best method of disambiguation: ""can you pass the salt"" is ambiguous from the point-of-view of lexical semantics, but a sentence is always said in a context - e.g. either at a dinner table, or by hikers on the edge of a salt flat - and here sentences are only very rarely ambiguous. Many schools of 20th century linguistics were obsessed with ambiguity in language, but if you start with an understanding of language as something that humans do - rather than a language being a set of sentences that can be generated by some grammar, N Chomsky 1958 - ambiguity is actually rather peripheral. The cooperative principle is also relevant to AI. We all know the Eliza effect, and, to me, nothing explains it better than Grice. We cannot help but cooperate with text, because that is how you make text work, so even when we know that it's just a robot reversing our sentences, or AI generated poetry (some of which actually reads remarkably well), we look for whatever meaning might be there, under the instinctive assumption that the author is trying to tell us something.

Yes, ChatGPT sometimes makes mistakes, contradicts itself, and loses track of its own reasoning. Those are all things that humans do frequently, although the frequency of those mistakes and in what contexts they're made is different. I have on many occasions gotten minutes into a discussion before realizing that I was simultaneously arguing for and against my own position, and having to step back and reexamine. Yet I'm pretty sure that I still understand things. Certainly, there are certain topics where ChatGPT can be said to utterly and consistently fail to understand, but again, there are many topics where a human will consistently fail to understand as well. I once sat in the middle of an intro philosophy class during which a room full of adults with highschool diplomas failed for thirty minutes straight to understand that ""if X then Y"" is not the same as ""if Y then X"" despite the TA's efforts using multiple real-world examples. I would not infer from that that those humans were incapable of understanding in general, but rather that they had not yet developed the cognitive tools to deal with logic abstractly. I've also seen plenty of examples of humans following the format of an explanation or argument while filling in the details with vague jargon and inapplicable nonsense, making their words sound official and superficially convincing, without actually doing the cognitive work to say anything useful. In fact, I've seen that in documents written by people in their capacity as professional engineers and managers. If you've worked in tech for any significant time, you've probably seen it too. But it would be wild for me to claim that the authors of those documents were generally incapable of understanding. Does that mean that ChatGPT definitely understands things? No. I think it means that we don't really know what we mean by words like ""understand"" yet, because up until now, we've only had to apply words like that to human brains, and we're generally happy to operate in a framework where we assume that human brains mostly work more or less the same way. But I have noticed a trend of people dramatically underestimating the actual practical things that GPT-3 can do based on their assumptions about how it works and what its limitations are.",2022-12-25 12:55,-1,-1,True,-1

If you've ever used ChatGPT, you know that it has interrupts when it thinks it is talking about something unacceptable, where it gives pre-canned lines decided by the creators about what it should say. This sounds like a good idea when it's done with reasonable things - you wouldn't want your AI to be racist would you? - but giving the people who run the servers for ChatGPT the ability to inject their own morals and political beliefs is a very real concern for people. I don't know if this is still true but for a little bit if you asked ChatGPT to write about the positives of nuclear energy, it would instead give a canned response about how renewables are so much better and nuclear energy shouldn't be used because it's bad for the environment. Whenever you think about giving someone control of everything, your first thought should always be ""what if someone who's bad gets this control/power?"" and not ""This is good because it agrees with me"". Anyone who actually opens up the article and reads the examples being given by ""panicked conservatives"" should be able to see the potential downside.

The concept of karma is closely associated with the idea of rebirth or reincarnation. It is believed that a person's actions in one life will determine the nature of their existence in the next life, and that this process will continue until the individual reaches spiritual liberation or enlightenment.

That â€˜songwriter â€˜you were talking to, Leon, who is using ChatGPT to write â€˜hisâ€™ lyrics because it is â€˜faster and easier ,â€™is participating in this erosion of the worldâ€™s soul and the spirit of humanity itself and, to put it politely, should fucking desist if he wants to continue calling himself a songwriter. 100% agree. AI is indeed an erosion of the world's soul by the conglomerate of tech companies who are rabid about going after short-term gains. The reason why people use ChatGPT is because using it is a maladapative response to go after the quickest solution, a response that would have been adaptive in a time of scarcity. However, it is displacing a world of art and creation that was at one time meant to showcase the emotional and intellectual expression of humans into a cash-grab  using cheap ""art"" that is soulless.

So the answer is that if you just feed it a bunch of data, it might be good at spitting out some similarly looking data but ultimately has little use. If you manage to get some experts sitting with it and give it instructions and explain the data, i.e. relating data to concepts, then you may get a model that can generate interesting things based on natural language, because it was taught how to interpret the data with natural language. That is the next crop of AI I believe. For example, in biotech, people are feeding it protein sequences and teach it what each protein are and how to relate certain concepts with the sequences.

Worth a debate sometime. The safety controls are also what AI consumers want, generally. I know using AI in professional settings I _really_ don't want it doing something embarrassing. The controls that keep it polite are effective in that regard. It can be a bit stilted, but that's how lots of interactions are; that's how it is speaking with a cashier or librarian. The limits can be frustrating (and inconsistent). I wanted to brainstorm a story about an ugly girl and instead it chided me for calling someone ugly. Certainly toxic positivity!

38550240,OpenAI execs informed Board of Altman concerns before firing,https://time.com/6342827/ceo-of-the-year-2023-sam-altman/,07/12/2023 5:13,38550244,"""One example came in late October, when an academic paper Toner wrote in her capacity at Georgetown was published. Altman saw it as critical of OpenAIâ€™s safety efforts and sought to push Toner off the board. Altman told one board member that another believed Toner ought to be removed immediately, which was not true, according to two people familiar with the discussions.

    This episode did not spur the boardâ€™s decision to fire Altman, those people say, but it was representative of the ways in which he tried to undermine good governance, and was one of several incidents that convinced the quartet that they could not carry out their duty of supervising OpenAIâ€™s mission if they could not trust Altman. Once the directors reached the decision, they felt it was necessary to act fast, worried Altman would detect that something was amiss and begin marshaling support or trying to undermine their credibility. â€œAs soon as he had an inkling that this might be remotely on the table,â€ another of the people familiar with the boardâ€™s discussions says, â€œhe would bring the full force of his skills and abilities to bear.â€

    ...The board expected pressure from investors and media. But they misjudged the scale of the blowback from within the company, in part because they had reason to believe the executive team would respond differently, according to two people familiar with the boardâ€™s thinking, who say the boardâ€™s move to oust Altman was informed by senior OpenAI leaders, who had approached them with a variety of concerns about Altmanâ€™s behavior and its effect on the companyâ€™s culture.

    ...Altman, 38, has been Silicon Valley royalty for a decade, a superstar founder with immaculate vibes...Interviews with more than 20 people in Altmanâ€™s circleâ€”including current and former OpenAI employees, multiple senior executives, and others who have worked closely with him over the yearsâ€”reveal a complicated portrait. Those who know him describe Altman as affable, brilliant, uncommonly driven, and gifted at rallying investors and researchers alike around his vision of creating artificial general intelligence (AGI) for the benefit of society as a whole. But four people who have worked with Altman over the years also say he could be slipperyâ€”and at times, misleading and deceptive. Two people familiar with the boardâ€™s proceedings say that Altman is skilled at manipulating people, and that he had repeatedly received feedback that he was sometimes dishonest in order to make people feel he agreed with them when he did not. These people saw this pattern as part of a broader attempt to consolidate power. â€œIn a lot of ways, Sam is a really nice guy; heâ€™s not an evil genius. It would be easier to tell this story if he was a terrible person,â€ says one of them. â€œHe cares about the mission, he cares about other people, he cares about humanity. But thereâ€™s also a clear pattern, if you look at his behavior, of really seeking power in an extreme way.â€ An OpenAI spokesperson said the company could not comment on the events surrounding Altmanâ€™s firing. â€œWeâ€™re unable to disclose specific details until the boardâ€™s independent review is complete. We look forward to the findings of the review and continue to stand behind Sam,â€ the spokesperson said in a statement to TIME. â€œOur primary focus remains on developing and releasing useful and safe AI, and supporting the new board as they work to make improvements to our governance structure.â€""",2023-12-07 05:14,0,0,True,0

It's because one wants to make some sort of analogy. One wants to bring in what one can gain by a study of how the brains of living creatures operate. This is the only possible reason for calling it artificial intelligence instead.

    Professor John McCarthy: Let's see. Excuse me. I invented the term artificial intelligence. I invented it because we had to do something when we were trying to get money for a summer study in 1956, and I had a previous bad experience. The previous bad experience concerns occurred in 1952, when Claude Shannon and I decided to collect a batch of studies, which we hoped would contribute to launching this field. And Shannon thought that artificial intelligence was too flashy a term and might attract unfavorable notice, and so we agreed to call it automata studies. I was terribly disappointed when the papers we received were about automata, and very few of them had anything to do with the goal that at least I was interested in. I decided not to fly any false flags anymore, but to say that this is a study aimed at the long-term goal of achieving human-level intelligence. Since that time, many people have quarreled with the term, but have ended up using it. Newell and Simon, the group at Carnegie Mellon University, tried to use complex information processing, which is certainly a very neutral term, but the trouble was that it didn't identify their field, because everyone would say, well, my information is complex.

It seems like they trained a few standard binary classifiers (Naive Bayes, decision trees, kNN). The novelty is the independent variable coming from an attribute precomputed for many known elliptic curves in the LMFDB database, namely the Dirichlet coefficients of the associated L-function; and the dependent variable being whether or not the elliptic curve has complex multiplication (CM), an important theoretical property for which lots of flashy theorems begin with assuming whether or not the curve has CM. They go on to train another binary classifier (and a separate size k classifier) to determine a curve's Sato-Tate identity component using the Euler coefficients and group-theoretic information about the Sato-Tate group (constructed by randomly sampling elements and representing the two non-trivial coefficients of their characteristic polynomials as independent variables in the classifier). They also run a PCA: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.01213.pdf The cool part is that they then stepped back and scratched their heads wondering why the classifier was so good at achieving separation for these dependent variables in the first place, and plotting the points showed them to be (non-linearly) separable due to a visually clear pattern! The punchline and the reason it's so important to understand these data points, the Euler coefficients for elliptic curves, is because they contain all the relevant number-theoretic information about the curve. With some major handwaving, understanding them perfectly would lead to things like the Langlands program (and some analogues of the Riemann hypothesis) getting resolved. These wide reaching conjectures are ultimately structural assertions about L-functions, and L-functions are uniquely specified by their Euler coefficients (the a_p term in their Euler factors). Will murmurations help with that? Who knows, but the more patterns the better for forming precise conjectures. Relevant intersectional credentials: I have lead ML engineering teams in industry and also did my doctorate work in this area of math, including using the LMFDB database referenced in the article for my research (which was much smaller back then and has grown a lot, so very neat to see it's still a force for empirical findings!).",2024-03-06 04:06,0,1,False,1

You can just subpoena the algorithm and then feed test data to it, and make observations. Even feed synthetic data like swapping in “stereotypically black” names for real resumes of other races, or in this case adding “uses a wheelchair” to a resume. (Of course in practice it’s more complex but hopefully this makes the point.) With a human, you can’t really do an A/B test to determine if they would have prioritized a candidate if they hadn’t included some signal; it’s really easy to rationalize away discrimination at the margins. So while most AI/ML developers are not currently strapping their models to a discrimination-tester, I think the end-state could be much better when they do. (I think a concrete solution would be to regulate these models to require a certification with some standardized test framework to show that developers have actually attempted to control these potential sources of bias. Google has done some good work in this area: https://ai.google/responsibilities/responsible-ai-practices/... - though there is nothing stopping model-sellers from self-regulating and publishing this testing first, to try to get ahead of formal regulation.)",2022-05-13 22:38,-1,-1,True,-1

AI means we can literally brute-force any scientific mystery by trying out millions of algorithms until we find one that fits (like Wolfram's New Kind of Science). General relativity was a brilliant theory, but we don't have billions of Einsteins to keep coming up with new theories. Soon, we will. And obviously, brute forcing is only a last resort, AIs will be smarter than that for most problem-sets. Who cares that it's a black box? Humans still need to verify a new model or theory (the AI will help with that too) but it'll shave decades off of discoveries. Why would humans lose domain knowledge? (There's plenty of non-economists writing economics papers already, and they seem human!) AI might dramatically increase the rate of scientific discoveries, and make a lot more people want to become scientists. It'll also help reclaim science from big institutions and academia, and help small independent groups make significant discoveries again without gatekeepers. Patent clerks might be able to make scientific discoveries again! And why would AI necessarily be purely imitative (i.e. only be capable of building off past knowledge, rather than generating new knowledge or at least using abstract reasoning)?

I don't read philosophy and I've never heard of Dennett before now. I used the following techniques: - If the question has more than one part, the answer should address every part. - The answer should not repeat itself or be too rambling. - The answer should not contradict itself. For example, the response that Jerry was ""never... less than serious"" but also wrote a ""hilarious parody"". - The answer should not recommend a book. This demonstrates a lack of context. A lot of people might recommend books when asked these questions in a web forum or  in person. But if you know that your answers are going into a quiz to distinguish your own thoughts from AI, you would probably focus on conveying your opinions and not referring to other material. (This is kind of cheating, since I'm using side channel information outside the question and answer texts.) - Answers with a ""yes, and""  flavor, that make a surprising but relevant connection to a new idea not mentioned in the question, are more likely to be human. For example, the joke (?) about having a baby in the robot question, or mentioning the use of religion as a tool for social control in addition to its origin as soothing people about frightening unknowns. - If multiple answers repeat a theme that is tenuously connected to the question, they are probably samples from GPT. For example, mentioning Copernicus in the question about evolution. (This would be harder if we only saw one GPT response!) These techniques don't require knowledge of Dennett's work.

Lastly, here is my dream for a good use of AI in psychiatry: With so much psychiatric care happening remotely, I would love to have a real-time dashboard/HUD with measures of disorganized speech patterns or affective intensity, etc, that I could use to supplement the information available via video link. It would be nice to have some additional data to make up for the trade-off of not being in the room. Perhaps one day with some kind of AR it might even be able to happen in the same room. It would be hard to make it not distracting, but done well it could add a lot. And if it went with the patient if they moved then it would be far more useful as it would be trained to their own personal variations.

I expect little to no digital art (images, videos, films, music, writing) will be sold for profit by human artists 10 years from now, and the only reason I haven't extended that to physical media like sculpture or street art is that I don't know whether we'll have dextrous enough robots to make those yet (though dextrous robots will indubitably come soon as well). People love to bring out the painting-and-photography example as a defense for why AI is not actually going to bring an end to the art market, but I just don't see it as a valid analogy. Photography and painting both survived because they're fundamentally different things and can be easily distinguished in cases where their respective artists choose to differentiate themselves. AI art is different, because its entire purpose is to replicate, and no matter what human artists do with the medium of digital images, the AI will always be right there to gobble up the new wave changes and learn to replicate them.

Artists and other creative professionals are raising concerns and not without reason. Many will lose their jobs, unable to compete with the new apps. Companies like OpenAI, Midjourney, and Stability.ai, although superpowered by the work of many creative workers, haven’t retributed them in any way. And AI users are standing on their shoulders, but without asking for permission first. As I argued there, AI art models like Stable Diffusion pertain to a new category of tools and should be understood with new frameworks of thought adapted to the new realities we’re living in. We can’t simply make analogies or parallelisms with other epochs and expect to be able to explain or predict what it’s going to happen accurately. Some things will be similar and others won’t. We have to treat this impending future as uncharted territory. I wonder if we'll also talk about ""conversations"", ""complex situations"" and ""the need to treat this as uncharted territory"" when some Copilot/GPT3 successor a few years down the line spits out entire production-ready software stacks off the prompt ""like Facebook only better"" - using our own code as training data.",2022-08-29 14:11,1,1,True,1

My title these days is roughly equivalent to what most people here seem to mean when they speak of ""staff engineers"". Granted, I'm relatively new to the title, but I feel like I've been approaching problems like a staff engineer would most of my career (~15 years). I have no idea if the author's guess is correct about Musk, but my own experience tells me that when solving a problem, many people get stuck on trying to accurately estimate how much effort/time/money a given solution would require. Whenever I find myself analyzing a problem, I follow a set path: 1. Brainstorm potential solutions, without regard for how wild they might appear.
    2. Roughly outline the potential positive and negative impacts of each - i.e., find the ""upper and lower bounds"" of each solution's impact
    3. Classify the potential solutions into rough categories, by identifying the ""decision points"" where work toward each solution no longer also progresses toward the other solutions. This builds an informal conceptual ""decision tree""
    4. Choose what path to take immediately. Often, all of the potential solutions require or would benefit from the same groundwork. If so, no decision needs to be made yet.
    5. Once I reach a ""fork in the decision tree"", refine my estimates of each solution only as much as is necessary to determine that one path down the tree is preferable
    6. Continue this process until the solution ultimately presents itself. This seems complicated when I write it out like that, but the gist of it is that I see estimation as non-productive work, and minimize it to the extent that I can. If there are two potential solutions, both of which provide similar benefits, and I can ballpark solution A as probably taking 10-20 hours while solution B will take 50-100 hours I see no reason to spend my time trying to refine my estimate for solution B. It doesn't matter if where it really is in the range; as long as I'm reasonably confident in the estimated ranges, the choice is clear. I will say that this approach has had mixed results for me. In some environments, I feel like not being able to provide more accurate estimates for all options has led to leadership seeing me as lazy and impulsive. My time at those places has been short and not very enjoyable. In other environments, I've built enough trust with my colleagues that they generally trusted my judgement. My time there has been longer on average, and much more fulfilling. As I've matured as a professional - and as a person - I've increasingly made the effort to explicitly state the thought process that I use to my peers. I accept (and even seek ) disagreement. When I find it, I try to set my perspective aside and focus on understanding the process through which they arrived at their positions. In all cases, this has been because one of us was operating under a starting condition that wasn't shared. _Usually_ this has been a more junior person missing something due to not having encountered it before, but not always. When I'm right I try to be gracious about it. I'm wrong I readily admit that and then go the extra mile later to recognize the person who led me the right direction, preferably by quantifying the impact of their perspective: ""We expected that the solution we were pursuing would have taken two weeks to implement; the solution presented by so-and-so reduced that to three days."" >  Over-simulation is a issue in many of our industries, and I think it is one of many reasons that our standard of living has gone down over the last six decades. I don't know that I agree with this statement at all. Regardless of whether or not it's true, the premise of the article as a whole remains valid. > Why am I even asking these questions? I have lived long enough to know the answer to all of them. Yes! If foolishly placing faith in artificial intelligence is the great existential filter implied by the Fermi paradox, then we may be about to filter ourselves out of existence. Even if it is not, we may further bankrupt ourselves in more ways than monetarily while looking for something to do the thinking for us that we are too lazy and too irresponsible to do for ourselves. I totally disagree with this conclusion. AI is just another tool, and knowing when to apply it will be the difference between efficiency and inefficiency. ""Placing faith"" in a tool is not something I would say that I do.

Before AI, the execution step was necessary, but not necessarily attached to the ""coming up with an idea"" step. Conceptual artists have for years (centuries?) produced ideas that were executed by others. AI makes the execution step near-instantaneous and almost free. It kind of erases it. It's more disintermediation than unbundling. Execution artists are being removed as gatekeepers. A question remains that, if an AI generator produces deterministic, consistent output given a set of (prompt, seed, model), does that mean that all possible images are somehow contained in the model? If there was a Borgesian book containing, say, all possible 512x512 images, one on each page, then surely two people having the same copy of that book wouldn't need to exchange images, they could simply exchange page numbers, and see exactly what the other one is referring to.

Back when I was in school, there was already plenty of debate about 'what is ""Art""'? It's always been hotly contested. Most of my teachers felt that 'technique' was not Art. Others were more purists – life painters, etc – and felt that, no, technique is art. Duchamp poked the art establishment in the eye with his 'readymades' (urinals on the gallery wall, etc.) Warhol with his 'factory' making silkscreens. The 'reverse Monet' (too lazy to link) that caused such an uproar when it was shared last week was ironic – apparently people aren't aware that the impressionists themselves were considered 'not artists' by a lot of people at the time. The camera and photography made many painters sit up and say, 'hey, it can't just be about ""image"" anymore' – enter abstract expressionism, fauvism, cubism, etc. Work that shifted the focus from the image represented in the painting ('a window into a world') onto the surface of the canvas itself: Rothko, Albers, etc. The thing is, people have wild misconceptions about what this technology does. Many clearly think it's a photocopier. As if StableDiffusion is hiding copies of all these works inside. When in fact what's been done is to take all of this online knowledge and create an incredible new tool with it. Like a music synthesizer times a million. It's understandable why this technology makes people uncomfortable. There are legit fears about displacement, economic uncertainty, etc. But we are fundamentally tool makers – it's arguably intrinsically part of what makes us human (borrowing from Carl Sagan's ""Dragons of Eden""). If I were back in the art department last century, I'm pretty sure we'd be really excitedly discussing how these new tools will enable entirely new forms of expression. And sure, there'd be the old guard saying it was awful, and 'not Art'. This is a really interesting debate – I just wish it scratched deeper than the surface more often than it does, with a bit more historical context.",2022-09-12 23:01,-1,-1,True,-1

Lets phrase the problem appropriately, this isn't new. Every new technology will be used for good or bad and not a day goes by before someone tries to deceive another entity, be it another human being in a car dealership price negotiation or a prompt to a text model. The reason models like GPT3 are so remarkable is that they learn a statistical relationship between incredibly vast amounts of unstructured data to mimic the semblance of intellect or reasoning. The FRAMEWORK that underpins GPT3 and most modern ""AI"" is a remarkable acceleration of the compute and inference resources that, when associated with large clumps of data, start unlocking immense value. To have such a strong assertion saying ""I don't know how to solve this, but hey, i KNOW FOR A FACT it isn't more of this advanced compute paradigm that has been the topic of many a success in the computer science discipline"" is a tabloid like take. You are going to get angry reactions like mine, but reactions nonetheless, thus driving more views to your headline and cycling it through the system. Smart people will take a stand, and others, to be controversial or looking from a contrarian POV will extend the conversation leading to a useless cycle of a waste of time. All we're seeing through these ""Prompt injection"" attacks is how loose the parameters for influence right now are, allowing for an open ended interaction with no boundaries with the statistical output of the model.

First off, NVENC is gone. Instead of 4x 1080p @ 30 (HEVC) that the Jetson Nano could do with GPU acceleration, this one can barely manage 2x 1080p @ 30. Apparently, too many people (myself included) used the Jetson Nano as a cheap camera recorder. Next, price went from $99 for a Jetson Nano to $299 for Jetson Orin Nano. And lastly, they now advertise 40 TOPS for Jetson Orin Nano but that's measured at 50% sparsity and for INT8... So it is in no way comparable to the 0.5 TFLOPS that a Jetson Nano has, which was measured at dense FP16. And the fact that I can't find any FP16 number for any Jetson Orin device is not a good look. In summary, this looks to me more like a TPU than a GPU, because they moved from FP16 to INT8 precision. That makes this much more similar to the mini PCIe Coral priced at $25 delivering 4 TOPS dense. Compared to that, Jetson Orin Nano is 5x faster and 12x more expensive. EDIT: In case you're wondering why I care about INT8 vs. FP16: The Jetson Nano can autonomously collect data and then calculate gradients and fine-tune the AI model. If the Jetson Orin Nano lacks FP16, it won't be able to do gradients and learning. So going from FP16 to INT8 is a downgrade from having AI training capabilities to pure execution of pre-trained AI models.",2022-09-21 15:01,0,0,True,0
