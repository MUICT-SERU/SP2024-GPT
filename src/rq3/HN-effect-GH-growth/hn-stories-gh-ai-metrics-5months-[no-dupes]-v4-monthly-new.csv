ggerganov,,33877893,399,"Hi HN,<p>OpenAI recently released a model for automatic speech recognition called Whisper [0]. I decided to reimplement the inference of the model from scratch using C&#x2F;C++. To achieve this I implemented a minimalistic tensor library in C and ported the high-level architecture of the model in C++. The entire code is less than 8000 lines of code and is contained in just 2 source files without any third-party dependencies. The Github project is here:<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ggerganov&#x2F;whisper.cpp"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ggerganov&#x2F;whisper.cpp</a><p>With this implementation I can very easily build and run the model - <i>“make base.en”</i>. It also allows me to run it on a wide range of devices. For example, I have provided examples of running the model on an iPhone, Raspberry Pi 4 and even in a web page via WebAssembly!<p>The implementation runs fully on the CPU and utilizes FP16, AVX intrinsics on x86 architectures and NEON + Accelerate framework on Apple Silicon. The latter is especially efficient and I observe that the inference is about 2-3 times faster compared to the current PyTorch implementation provided by OpenAI when running it on my MacBook M1 Pro. The WASM port utilizes SIMD 128-bit intrinsics - a feature supported in some modern web browsers [1].<p>I am very happy with the performance that I observe on Apple Silicon devices. I didn’t expect that the Accelerate framework [2] (i.e. CBLAS) offers such a dramatic performance boost for matrix multiplications so I was very pleasantly surprised! To enable the framework in your C&#x2F;C++ projects, all you have to do is add <i>`-framework Accelerate`</i> to your clang command-line flags.<p>This entire exercise of implementing the Whisper model was very interesting to me and helped me understand a lot about how the transformer architecture works. I also got a lot of positive feedback from people finding and using my project. We brainstormed on a lot of interesting tools that can potentially be created with this library (such as speech-to-text plugin for Vim, RPi4 voice assistant, WASM chat bot, etc). If interested, checkout the “Examples” section and the “Show and tell” discussions for some ideas!<p>Would love to know what you think about this project and about your experience with using the Accelerate framework in any of your projects.

bluecoconut,,34194860,9,"For the past few months I&#x27;ve been building a lot of things with LLMs (GPT-3, Codex, etc.) as I&#x27;ve been trying to push them to their limits (especially towards applying them to the tabular data domain)<p>When working on this, I&#x27;ve found there are some common patterns for solving problems (templating, chaining, functional-programming style operations, etc.) As I&#x27;ve iterated, I&#x27;ve come to believe that a functional style interface is likely going to power a new wave of systems I&#x27;m calling &quot;prompt-machines&quot;(systems where the core new unit of work is a &quot;named&quot; LLM prompt, extending the &quot;function&quot; concept). Additionally, in order to make the code capable of meta-prompting (where the LLM can write its own templated prompts), I aimed to make the interface and library as simple and lightweight as possible. I think I&#x27;ve achieved my goal, so I&#x27;m releasing the library to share with others!<p>I mainly use lambdaprompt in two main ways: (1) to quickly try out &quot;map&quot; applying a LLM prompt against multiple inputs, to see how it behaves on a fixed set of inputs (2) to quickly iterate on a prompt-chain (taking the output of a prompt, and passing it to other prompts) to create complex behavior.<p>An example of (2) that worked quite well is a Text-2-SQL prototype: It generates multiple SQL options, then executes each against the database (if it errors, asks `Codex-EDIT` to fix the errors and retry), then takes the most &quot;consistent&quot; answer as the valid answer. Simply by adding this prompt-chain on top of codex, we saw an improvement from ~75% to ~85% on a spider Text-2-SQL benchmark (On just a small sample of N=200).<p>To increase usability it also ships (extras) with a fastapi app that registers any defined prompts as endpoints directly, and hosts the functions to be directly callable via HTTP-GET requests. This makes it easy to build client-applications off of these prompts, while allowing the prompt itself to be arbitrarily complex (composition of prompts)<p>I hope you enjoy using it!<p>Also, I&#x27;m super curious to hear if anyone else has been thinking about LLMs (composing them, building interfaces to them, etc.) in similar ways and what learnings have been (even if not though this library)",1672478000,2022-12-31 09:13:20 UTC,"Show HN: lambdaprompt – build, compose and call templated LLM prompts",story,https://github.com/approximatelabs/lambdaprompt,31/12/2022 9:13,124,44,57,39,30,14,5,2,3,0,14,0,6,0,2,0,10,0,6,1,3,1,3,2,2,1,1,0,1,0

This CLI tool enables you to chat with ChatGPT, choose between different assistants, and even create your own customized assistants by specifying the model, temperature, and top_p parameters. You can also set default configurations, making it a breeze to switch between assistants for various purposes like general assistance or software development advice.<p>gpt-cli provides a seamless experience with multi-line input and easy-to-use commands to control the conversation. It allows you to clear the conversation, regenerate the last response, or exit the session with simple keypresses. You can also override model parameters on the fly to fine-tune the AI&#x27;s output. To get started, simply set the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable or put it in the ~&#x2F;.gptrc config file. Check out the README for more details on usage, configuration, and customization possibilities.

jlowin,,35366838,127,"Hey HN! We&#x27;re excited to share our new open-source project, Marvin. Marvin is a high-level library for building AI-powered software. We developed it to address the challenges of integrating LLMs into more traditional applications. One of the biggest issues is the fact that LLMs only deal with strings (and conversational strings at that), so using them to process structured data is especially difficult.<p>Marvin introduces a new concept called AI Functions. These look and feel just like regular Python functions: you provide typed inputs, outputs, and docstrings. However, instead of relying on traditional source code, AI functions use LLMs like GPT-4 as a sort of “runtime” to generate outputs on-demand, based on the provided inputs and other details. The results are then parsed and converted back into native data types.<p>This “functional prompt engineering” means you can seamlessly integrate AI functions with your existing codebase. You can chain them together with other functions to form sophisticated, AI-enabled pipelines. They’re particularly useful for tasks that are simple to describe yet challenging to code, such as entity extraction, semantic scraping, complex filtering, template-based data generation, and categorization. For example, you could extract terms from a contract as JSON, scrape websites for quotes that support an idea, or build a list of questions from a customer support request. All of these would yield structured data that you could immediately start to process.<p>We initially created Marvin to tackle broad internal use cases in customer service and knowledge synthesis. AI Functions are just a piece of that, but have proven to be even more effective than we anticipated, and have quickly become one of our favorite features! We’re eager for you to try them out for yourself.<p>We’d love to hear your thoughts, feedback, and any creative ways you could use Marvin in your own projects.

Sometimes the error might have many different reasons and search results shows many solutions. Many hours passed and I usually gets frustrated.<p>I feel making ChatGPT to be the initial debugger to guide whats the error means and what should I look for to fix this error.<p>I took some inspiration from this(<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nvbn&#x2F;thefuck"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nvbn&#x2F;thefuck</a>) CLI tool I was introduced some years ago, which helps fix common errors in your cli command like misstype or need sudo. So my CLI does fetch the last command run, rerun it and fetch the stderr to be feed into ChatGPT for help.<p>I am looking to see if anyone find it helpful since I have been using it lightly and only when I hit errors. So of you can try it out when you face errors and share how helpful its solution is. Also open to see if anyone has idea to improve the prompt or how it works.<p>Please note: dont use it with any commands that’s destructive because it would rerun the command. Also dont use with command that contains sensitive information like security tokens etc.",1681772812,2023-04-17 23:06:52 UTC,Show HN: CLI tool to fix command line errors with ChatGPT,story,https://github.com/shahnk19/gpt-comrade,17/4/2023 23:06,1,0,3,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

jarulraj,,35764355,237,"Hi friends,<p>We are building EVA, an AI-Relational database system with first-class support for deep learning models. Our goal with EVA is to create a platform that supports AI-powered multi-modal database applications operating on structured (tables, feature vectors, etc.) and unstructured data (videos, podcasts, pdf, etc.) with deep learning models. EVA comes with a wide range of models for analyzing unstructured data, including models for object detection, OCR, text summarization, audio speech recognition, and more.<p>The key feature of EVA is its AI-centric query optimizer. This optimizer is designed to speed up AI-powered applications using a collection of optimizations inspired by relational database systems. Two of the most important optimizations are:<p>+ Caching: EVA automatically reuses previous query results (e.g., inference results), eliminating redundant computation and saving you money on inference.<p>+ Predicate Reordering: EVA optimizes the order in which query predicates are evaluated (e.g., running faster, more selective deep learning models first), leading to faster queries.<p>Besides saving money spent on inference, EVA also makes it easier to write SQL queries to set up multi-modal AI pipelines. With EVA, you can quickly integrate your AI models into the database system and seamlessly query structured and unstructured data.<p>We are constantly working on improving EVA and would love to hear your feedback!",1682873521,2023-04-30 16:52:01 UTC,Show HN: EVA – AI-Relational Database System,story,https://github.com/georgia-tech-db/eva,30/4/2023 16:52,1457,149,6,0,0,0,427,510,2,0,0,0,190,222,2,0,0,0,46,8,0,0,0,0,16,11,2,0,0,0

savbell,,35867597,2,"WhisperWriter is a small dictation app that uses OpenAI&#x27;s Whisper speech recognition model to auto-transcribe recordings from a user&#x27;s microphone. I built it with the help of ChatGPT (with GPT-4) and GitHub Copilot, with almost every line of code in the repository written by AI.<p><i>Running the app:</i> Everything you need to know to set WhisperWriter up is in the linked GitHub repo&#x27;s README file. The app can be run locally using the open-source Whisper release or online through the OpenAI API. I personally use the latter because my computer is not very powerful, but the former is free and doesn&#x27;t require an OpenAI account.<p><i>The inspiration:</i> I have a disability that makes it painful to type on a keyboard. As a software engineer, this has a considerable impact on my daily life. I&#x27;ve tried using the built-in Windows dictation tools, but they are very buggy and extremely frustrating to use. I was actually getting pretty close to quitting tech as a whole because of all the difficulties I would run into when trying to code. But I recently started playing around with AI coding assistants – and they&#x27;ve been a complete game-changer for me.<p>Last month, I made a small web app for fun, entirely coded by GPT (&lt;<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;savbell&#x2F;playlist-gpt"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;savbell&#x2F;playlist-gpt</a>&gt;). Since AI wrote most of the code, it required minimal keyboard use on my end – but I still needed to type up the prompts, which was causing me significant pain. I&#x27;d heard about OpenAI recently releasing a speech recognition model called Whisper, but nobody had written a dictation app using it yet. So I decided to continue to test out GPT&#x27;s programming abilities and used it to write my own speech-to-text app that now vastly outperforms the built-in Windows ones! (At least, for my specific use cases.) I now use WhisperWriter every day for almost anything that I need to type, such as prompting ChatGPT – and even writing out this post!<p><i>The process:</i> Using ChatGPT, it only took about two hours to build a fully-functioning command-line app that did exactly what I wanted it to do. I spent a few more hours adding a pop-up status window and some more configuration options, but really the core app was completed in less than an afternoon. I even used the prototype to dictate my prompts to ChatGPT to add all the additional features!<p>I&#x27;m considering writing an article with more details about the exact prompts I used and the lessons I learned along the way, à la this post from two days ago: &lt;<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=35839536"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=35839536</a>&gt;. Since it would be a lot of typing&#x2F;dictating, I&#x27;m on the fence about it, but please let me know in the comments if it would be interesting! I&#x27;ve used ChatGPT to built six small apps in total so I have a lot of insights to share.<p><i>Why I&#x27;m sharing:</i> Three main reasons:<p>1. WhisperWriter is small, hasn&#x27;t been well-tested, and is tailored to my own personal use case. However, it&#x27;s been completely life-changing. I wanted to share it because if there&#x27;s even a chance that someone else who is struggling with similar issues might see it and use it too, I want to take that!<p>2. I wanted to share a concrete example of how AI can be used to improve people&#x27;s quality-of-life in small ways. There is so much talk about the bigger-picture impacts of AI, but I wanted to showcase how technologies like AI coding assistants have opened up endless possibilities for people to change their own lives in small ways, such as by building apps tailored to their own specific day-to-day problems.<p>3. I think Whisper is super cool and I want to show off some of its capabilities in hopes that it encourages others to play around with it, too. I&#x27;d love to see someone expand upon my work or speech-to-text tech in general, since any improvements in that area can increase accessibility for not just me, but many other people who may be facing similar disabilities or challenges.<p>Thanks for reading everyone!

I&#x27;ve been working alongside a trusty group of contributors to bring this project to life, and we&#x27;re now at a point where we&#x27;re ready to share it with the world.<p>Large language models (LLMs) are taking the computing world by storm due to their emergent abilities that allow them to perform a wide variety of tasks, including translation, summarization, code generation, and even some degree of reasoning. However, the ecosystem around LLMs is still in its infancy, and it can be difficult to get started with these models.<p>`llm` is a one-stop shop for running inference on large language models (of the kind that power ChatGPT and more); we provide a CLI and a Rust crate for running inference on these models, all entirely open-source. The crate can be embedded in your own projects, allowing you to easily integrate LLMs into your own applications.<p>We hope that `llm` can help to alleviate some of the pain points that users face when working with LLMs. Our goal is to build a robust solution for inferencing on LLMs that users can rely on for their projects, so that we can provide a moment of peace in the chaos of the LLM ecosystem.<p>At present, we are powered by `ggml` (similar to `llama.cpp`), but we intend to add additional backends in the near-future.

vaibkumr,,36014570,4,"For enterprises, OpenAI (and similar other) API Bills can be pretty high, any optimization per prompt could result in saving hundreds or even thousands of dollars over multiple calls.<p>It is possible to reduce these costs by optimizing the number of tokens in the prompt. We call this &quot;minimizing the token complexity&quot;. Informally speaking, token complexity is the estimated  number of tokens required in input prompt to achieve a task. I understand more theory is required to formally describe token complexity and we are working on a paper for same.<p>PromptOptimizer provides a set of optimizers (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;promptoptimizer.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;reference.html#module-prompt_optimizer.poptim"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;promptoptimizer.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;reference.h...</a>) and metrics to evaluate optimizations. As a framework, it is very easy to extend it by creating custom optimizers (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;promptoptimizer.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;extend&#x2F;custom_optims.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;promptoptimizer.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;extend&#x2F;cust...</a>).<p>There&#x27;s a lot that can be done but for now we provide a set of preliminary optimizers and their performance evaluation here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vaibkumr&#x2F;prompt-optimizer#evaluations"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vaibkumr&#x2F;prompt-optimizer#evaluations</a><p>There&#x27;s a lot that can&#x27;t be done because we don&#x27;t assume access to model weights, logits or decoding process. We are trying to do the best with just optimizing the number of tokens in input prompts.<p>My personal favorite is EntropyOptim: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;promptoptimizer.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;reference.html#prompt_optimizer.poptim.EntropyOptim"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;promptoptimizer.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;reference.h...</a>  It uses a Masked Language Model to remove low entropy words (they can easily be inferred by good LLMs). Certainly, sometimes we would not want to lose important tokens for which we provide ignore tags in our framework.<p>No free lunch: The reduction in cost often comes with a loss in LLM performance as can be observed here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vaibkumr&#x2F;prompt-optimizer#cost-performance-tradeoff"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vaibkumr&#x2F;prompt-optimizer#cost-performanc...</a><p>The eventual goal of this project is:<p>1. A one-stop solution for saving LLM API costs. Most of the existing works in this direction focus on vector stores and semantic cache. This project is perfectly compatible with those techniques and might include own implementations in future.<p>2. Extending &quot;token complexity&quot; theory formally.<p>3. Open leaderboard style evaluations in terms of minimizing prompt and continuation tokens for solving a task.<p>4.

Our goal is to &quot;automagically&quot; enable performant, cost-effective self-hosting of released state of the art&#x2F;best of breed models to enable speech and language tasks:<p>Primarily targeting CUDA (works on CPU too) with support for low-end (cheap) devices such as the Tesla P4, GTX 1060, and up. Don&#x27;t worry - it screams on an RTX 4090 too! (See benchmarks on Github).<p>Memory optimized - all three default Whisper (base, medium, large-v2) models loaded simultaneously with TTS support inside of 6GB VRAM. LLM support defaults to int4 quantization (conversion scripts included). ASR&#x2F;STT + TTS + Vicuna 13B require roughly 18GB VRAM. Less for 7B, of course!<p>ASR. Heavy emphasis - Whisper optimized for very high quality as-close-to-real-time-as-possible speech recognition via a variety of means (Willow, WebRTC, POST a file, integration with devices and client applications, etc). Results in hundreds of milliseconds or less for most intended speech tasks. See YouTube WebRTC demo[0].<p>TTS. Primarily provided for assistant tasks (like Willow!) and visually impaired users.<p>LLM. Optionally pass input through a provided&#x2F;configured LLM for question answering, chatbot, and assistant tasks. Currently supports LLaMA deriviates with strong preference for Vicuna (I like 13B). Built in support for quantization to int4 to conserve GPU memory.<p>Support for a variety of transports. REST, WebRTC, Web Sockets (primarily for LLM).<p>Performance and memory optimized. Leverages CTranslate2 for Whisper support and AutoGPTQ for LLMs.<p>Willow support. WIS powers the Tovera hosted best-effort example server Willow users enjoy.<p>Support for WebRTC - stream audio in real-time from browsers or WebRTC applications to optimize quality and response time. Heavily optimized for long-running sessions using WebRTC audio track management. Leave your session open for days at a time and have self-hosted ASR transcription within hundreds of milliseconds while conserving network bandwidth and CPU!<p>Support for custom TTS voices. With relatively small audio recordings WIS can create and manage custom TTS voices.

This becomes especially complex when the AI needs to e.g. make API calls to retrieve information or trigger actions.<p>AI Tool Bridge for PHP elegantly solves this problem by offering a straightforward interface to define &quot;tool functions&quot; that the AI can utilize when it needs to interact with external systems.<p>An important optimization is the library&#x27;s capability to generate the required JSON structure for a tool function. It does so by requesting only the required values from the AI and then generating the JSON based on a provided JSON schema. This approach guarantees the validity of the final JSON that reaches your application code.<p>Key features of this library include:<p>- Facilitating the definition of tools that the AI can use for external interactions.<p>- Providing a robust prompt structure to guide the AI on when and how to use these tools.<p>- Ensuring that the tools are triggered with complete and correctly formatted JSON.<p>The code is still early stage, but I&#x27;m already using it successfully to build an AI-powered end-user application where the AI has the ability to talk to several of my external software systems and can trigger my own application code, all without the need for any official and public GPT-4 plugins.",1684924284,2023-05-24 10:31:24 UTC,Show HN: Make an AI talk to your own PHP code using Tool Functions,story,https://github.com/manuelkiessling/php-ai-tool-bridge,24/5/2023 10:31,7,5,5,1,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0

oliverf,,36154759,35,"Hi HN,<p>I’m the founder of Pangea. We’ve built a developer platform where you can easily add security to your code through a simple set of APIs - features like authentication, secrets management, audit logging, redaction of PII, restricting embargoed countries, known threat actor intelligence, etc.<p>With the ChatGPT and LLM explosion, we thought of ways to reduce the risk of both the inputs and outputs from these services. Our NextJS sample app adds a security layer on top of ChatGPT with various security services that you can implement quickly.<p>It’s basically a front end to the OpenAI API that you can deploy which does a few security-related things:<p>- AuthN - it provides authentication to track who inputs what and when<p>- Redact - provides PII redaction with detection of over 40 different types of sensitive information<p>- Secure Audit Log - logs the user, cleansed prompt, and model to a secure tamper-proof audit trail<p>- Sends the cleansed prompt to the OpenAI API and receives the response<p>- Domain Intel - Performs a Domain Reputation lookup on any domain names in the response<p>- URL Intel - Performs a URL Reputation lookup on any URLs in the response<p>- Defangs any malicious domains or URLs found in the response<p>- On closing your session, the history of prompts disappears<p>Storing what users have prompted allows you to better train your model, feed it more relevant information, and keep an audit log of the history. The Secure Audit Log service can store the user inputs in a secure log so that you can track who did what and when.<p>The final layer of defense is a Domain Intel service to detect and neutralize the malicious URLs and domain names in the OpenAI API&#x27;s response.<p>The proof-of-concept app is open-source on GitHub.

szopa,,36198494,14,"Hi HN,<p>I&#x27;m thrilled to share with you think, a command-line tool that I developed while diving back into the programming scene.<p>For the past few years, my focus had shifted from hands-on programming to managerial roles, my last one being at Affirm (I started Affirm&#x27;s Polish office). However, I recently left my job to revisit my passion for coding and see if I could still write code that works. Not to mention that with what is currently going on in AI if you are a developer this probably the best possible time for a sabbatical in human history :)<p>My first attempt was with LangChain, but I found it too abstract and elusive for my liking. I knew that Python was the go-to for serious ML research, but as I was primarily dealing with API calls, I wasn&#x27;t bound to it. So I picked Go for its simplicity, performance, and to spare myself from the notorious Python dependency issues.<p>Over the last few weeks, I&#x27;ve been hacking on Agency (github.com&#x2F;ryszard&#x2F;agency), a framework for writing agents backed by AI. Agency provides an idiomatic interface to various LLM providers (currently OpenAI works and Hugging Face is experimental&#x2F;brokenish). It simplifies the creation and management of Language Learning Model-based agents, aiding the implementation of autonomous agent systems. It also offers features for production deployment, like caching, retrying, or rate limiting. The idea was to allow managing how data flows between different AI agents without sacrificing my sanity.<p>With Agency as my foundation, I was able to write think over the course of a weekend. Most of that time was spent figuring out the right UX (and how to use the readline library, whose documentation is... sparse).<p>Today, I&#x27;m presenting you with think – a utility that uses OpenAI&#x27;s AI models to assist in crafting shell commands.

We&#x27;ve undertaken a rewrite of the core search framework, which now acts as an LLM agent, significantly improving the number of queries that can be successfully answered.<p>There&#x27;s a bunch of hype surrounding LLM agents, but we&#x27;re positive this is one of the first implementations of an agent that can deliver immediate value for engineers working on existing projects, especially larger ones. We&#x27;ll do a full write up of how the agent works and the tools it can use soon, but we wanted to share our progress, now that we&#x27;ve got a stable release.<p>bloop is a developer assistant that uses GPT-4 to answer questions about your codebase. The agent searches both your local and remote repositories with natural language, regex and filtered queries.<p>Some of the ways engineers use bloop to improve their efficiency when working on large codebases:<p>- Summarise how large files work and how multiple files work together<p>- Understand how to use open source libraries when documentation is lacking<p>- Identify the origin of errors<p>- Ask questions about English-language codebases in other languages<p>- Reduce code duplication by checking for existing functionality<p>- Write new code, taking into account existing codebase context (eg: &quot;write a dockerfile for this project&quot;)<p>bloop runs as a free desktop app on Mac, Windows and Linux: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bloopAI&#x2F;bloop&#x2F;releases&#x2F;latest"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bloopAI&#x2F;bloop&#x2F;releases&#x2F;latest</a>. On desktop, your code is indexed with a MiniLM embedding model and stored locally, meaning at index time your codebase stays private. &#x27;Private&#x27; here means that no code is shared with us or OpenAI at index time, and when a search is made only relevant code snippets are shared to generate the response. (This is more or less the same data usage as Copilot).<p>We also have a paid cloud offering for teams ($45 per user per month). Members of the same organisation can search a shared index hosted by us and will get access to enterprise only features down the line (currently there&#x27;s no feature gap between desktop and cloud).",1686331152,2023-06-09 17:19:12 UTC,Show HN: Bloop – Answer questions about your code with an LLM agent,story,https://github.com/BloopAI/bloop,9/6/2023 17:19,1027,192,537,121,154,147,347,328,378,317,277,273,189,140,195,164,154,102,81,19,41,15,27,13,7,6,13,11,10,7

narenkmano,,36521699,19,"We&#x27;re excited to share a tool we&#x27;ve been working on called gpt-code-search. It allows you to search any codebase using natural language locally on your machine. We leverage OpenAI&#x27;s GPT-4 and function calling to retrieve, search, and answer queries about your code.<p>All you need to do is to install the package with `pip install gpt-code-search`, set up your `OPENAI_API_KEY` as an environment variable, and start asking questions with `gpt-code-search query &lt;your question&gt;`.<p>E.g. You can ask questions like &quot;How do I use the analytics module?&quot; or &quot;Document all the API routes related to authentication.&quot;<p>This is still early and hacked together in the past week, but we wanted to get it out there and get feedback.<p>We utilize OpenAI&#x27;s function calling to let GPT-4 call certain predefined functions in our library. You do not need to implement any of these functions yourself. These functions are designed to interact with your codebase and return enough context for the LLM to perform code searches without pre-indexing it or uploading your repo to a third party other than OpenAI. So, you only need to run the tool from the directory you want to search.<p>The functions currently available for the LLM to call are:<p>`search_codebase` - searches the codebase using a TF-IDF vectorizer<p>`get_file_tree` - provides the file tree of the codebase<p>`get_file_contents` - provides the contents of a file<p>These functions are implemented in `gpt-code-search` and are triggered by chat completions. The LLM is prompted to utilize the search_codebase and get_file_tree function as needed to find the necessary context to answer your query and then loops as needed to collect more context with the get_file_contents until the LLM responds.<p>A couple of limitations of this approach, GPT cannot load context across multiple files in a single prompt since we are passing in the contents of a single file in each function call. So, GPT repeatedly calls the get_file_contents function to load context from multiple files. This increases the latency and cost of the tool.<p>Another thing we realized as we were building is that the level of search and retrieval is limited by the context window, which refers to the scope of the search conducted by the tool, meaning that we can only search five levels deep in the file system and can only pass in the contents of one file at a time. So it would be best to run the tool from the package&#x2F;directory closest to the code you want to search.<p>We plan to add support for local vector embeddings to improve search and retrieval. Combining the vector embeddings with function calling should result in much faster and higher quality results.<p>Also, support for other models, chat interactions in the command line, and generating code is already on our backlog!<p>Please check out gpt-code-search and let me know your thoughts, feedback, or suggestions.",1688052331,2023-06-29 15:25:31 UTC,Show HN: Open-source code search with OpenAI's function calling,story,https://github.com/wolfia-app/gpt-code-search,29/6/2023 15:25,46,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0

It works pretty simply:<p>1) Create a list of test cases<p>2) Set up assertions for metrics&#x2F;guardrails you care about, such as outputting only JSON or not saying &quot;As an AI language model&quot;<p>3) Run tests as you make changes.  Integrate with CI if desired.<p>This makes LLM model and prompt selection easier because it reduces the process to something we&#x27;re all familiar with: developing against test cases.  You can iterate with confidence and avoid regressions.<p>There are a bunch of startups popping up in this space, but I think it&#x27;s important to have something that is local (private), on the command line (easy to use in the development loop), and open-source.",1689787657,2023-07-19 17:27:37 UTC,Show HN: CLI for testing and evaluating LLM prompts and outputs,story,https://github.com/promptfoo/promptfoo,19/7/2023 17:27,117,338,165,182,160,191,107,143,70,129,88,123,33,61,44,70,41,63,3,8,15,12,13,17,3,5,7,7,3,7

With the launch of Llama 2, we think it’s finally viable to self-host an internal application that’s on-par with ChatGPT, so we did exactly that and made it an open source project.<p>We also included a vector DB and API server so you can upload files and connect Llama 2 to your own data.<p>The RAG in RAGstack stands for Retrieval Augmented Generation, a technique where the capabilities of a large language model (LLM) are augmented by retrieving information from other systems and inserting them into the LLM’s context window via a prompt. This gives LLMs information beyond what was provided in their training data, which is necessary for almost every enterprise application. Examples include data from current web pages, data from SaaS apps like Confluence or Salesforce, and data from documents like sales contracts and PDFs.<p>RAG works better than fine-tuning the model because it’s cheaper, it’s faster, and it’s more reliable since the provenance of information is attached to each response.<p>While there are quite quite a few “chat with your data” apps at this point, most have external dependencies to APIs like OpenAI or Pinecone. RAGstack, on the other hand, only has open-source dependencies and lets you run the entire stack locally or on your cloud provider. This includes:<p>- Containerizing LLMs like Falcon, Llama2, and GPT4all with Truss - Vector search with Qdrant. - File parsing and ingestion with Langchain, PyMuPDF, and Unstructured.io - Cloud deployment with Terraform<p>If you want to dive into it yourself, we also published a couple of tutorials on how to deploy open source LLMs for your organization, and optionally give it access to internal documents without any data ever leaving your VPC.<p>- How to deploy Llama 2 to Google Cloud (GCP):  <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.psychic.dev&#x2F;post&#x2F;how-to-deploy-llama-2-to-google-cloud-gcp"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.psychic.dev&#x2F;post&#x2F;how-to-deploy-llama-2-to-google...</a> - How to connect Llama 2 to your own data using RAGstack: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.psychic.dev&#x2F;post&#x2F;how-to-self-host-llama-2-and-connect-it-to-your-private-data"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.psychic.dev&#x2F;post&#x2F;how-to-self-host-llama-2-and-co...</a><p>Let a thousand private corporate oracles bloom!",1689873068,2023-07-20 17:11:08 UTC,"Show HN: RAGstack – private ChatGPT for enterprise VPCs, built with Llama 2",story,https://github.com/psychic-api/rag-stack,20/7/2023 17:11,499,74,102,55,37,43,25,1,0,0,0,0,18,2,0,0,0,0,46,9,20,6,8,4,8,1,0,0,0,0

We created Khoj as a hobby project 2+ years ago because: (1) Search on the desktop sucked; we just had keyword search on the desktop vs google for the internet; and (2) Natural language search models had become good and easy to run on consumer hardware by this point.<p>Once we made Khoj search incremental, I completely stopped using the default incremental search (C-s) in Emacs. Since then Khoj has grown to support more content types, deeper integrations and chat (using ChatGPT). With Llama 2 released last week, chat models are finally good and easy enough to use on consumer hardware for the chat with docs scenario.<p>Khoj is a desktop application to search and chat with your personal notes, documents and images. It is accessible from within Emacs, Obsidian or your Web browser. It works with org-mode, markdown, pdf, jpeg files and notion, github repositories. It is open-source and can work without internet access (e.g on a plane).<p>Our chat feature allows you to extract answers and create content from your existing knowledge base. Example: <i>&quot;What was that book Trillian mentioned at Zaphod&#x27;s birthday last week&quot;</i>. We personally use the chat feature regularly to find links, names and addresses (especially on mobile) and collate content across multiple, messy notes. It works online or offline: you can chat without internet using Llama 2 or with internet using GPT3.5+ depending on your requirements.<p>Our search feature lets you quickly find relevant notes, documents or images using natural language. It does not use the internet. Example: Search for <i>&quot;bought flowers at grocery store&quot;</i> will find notes about <i>&quot;roses at wholefoods&quot;</i>.<p>Quickstart:<p><pre><code>  pip install khoj-assistant &amp;&amp; khoj </code></pre> See <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.khoj.dev&#x2F;#&#x2F;setup"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.khoj.dev&#x2F;#&#x2F;setup</a> for detailed instructions<p>We also have desktop apps (in beta) at <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;khoj-ai&#x2F;khoj&#x2F;releases&#x2F;tag&#x2F;0.10.0"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;khoj-ai&#x2F;khoj&#x2F;releases&#x2F;tag&#x2F;0.10.0</a> if you want to try them out.<p>Please do try out Khoj and let us know if it works for your use cases? <i>Looking forward to the feedback!</i>",1690737262,2023-07-30 17:14:22 UTC,Show HN: Khoj – Chat offline with your second brain using Llama 2,story,https://github.com/khoj-ai/khoj,30/7/2023 17:14,1285,211,115,98,182,126,111,58,170,233,59,132,51,13,34,70,27,40,60,7,11,15,15,11,6,3,5,5,4,2

nichochar,,37034575,161,"Hi HN, we are Nick and Ben, creators of Axilla - an open source TypeScript framework to develop LLM applications. It’s in the early stages but you can use it today: we’ve already published 2 modules and have more coming soon.<p>Ben and I met while working at Cruise on the ML platform for self-driving cars. We spent many years there and learned the hard way that shipping AI is not quite the same as shipping regular code. There are many parts of the ML lifecycle, e.g., mining, processing, and labeling data and training, evaluating, and deploying models. Although none of them are rocket science, most of the inefficiencies tend to come from integrating them together. At Cruise, we built an integrated framework that accelerated the speed of shipping models to the car by 80%.<p>With the explosion of generative AI, we are seeing software teams building applications and features with the same inefficiencies we experienced at Cruise.<p>This got us excited about building an opinionated, end-to-end platform. We started building in Python but quickly noticed that most of the teams we talked to weren’t using Python, but instead building in TypeScript. This is because most teams are not training their own models, but rather using foundational ones served by third parties over HTTP, like openAI, anthropic or even OSS ones from hugging face.<p>Because of this, we’ve decided to build Axilla as a TypeScript first library.<p>Our goal is to build a modular framework that can be adopted incrementally yet benefits from full integration. For example, the production responses coming from the LLM should be able to be sent — with all necessary metadata — to the eval module or the labeling tooling.<p>So far, we’ve shipped 2 modules, that are available to use today on npm:<p>* *axgen*: focused on RAG type workflows. Useful if you want to ingest data, get the embeddings, store it in a vector store and then do similarity search retrieval. It’s how you give LLMs memory or more context about private data sources.<p>* *axeval*: a lightweight evaluation library, that feels like jest (so, like unit tests). In our experience, evaluation should be really easy to setup, to encourage continuous quality monitoring, and slowly build ground truth datasets of edge cases that can be used for regression testing, and fine-tuning.<p>We are working on a serving module and a data processing one next and would love to hear what functionality you need us to prioritize!<p>We built an open-source demo UI for you to discover the framework more: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;axilla-io&#x2F;demo-ui"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;axilla-io&#x2F;demo-ui</a><p>And here&#x27;s a video of Nicholas walking through the UI that gives an idea of what axgen can do: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;458f9b6679b740f0a5c78a33fffee3dc"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;458f9b6679b740f0a5c78a33fffee3dc</a><p>We’d love to hear your feedback on the framework, you can let us know here, create an issue on the GitHub repo or send me an email at nicholas@axilla.io<p>And of course, contributions welcome!",1691416838,2023-08-07 14:00:38 UTC,Show HN: Axilla – Open-source TypeScript framework for LLM apps,story,https://github.com/axilla-io/ax,7/8/2023 14:00,674,38,0,0,0,0,123,90,0,0,0,0,52,27,0,0,0,0,26,2,0,0,0,0,2,3,0,0,0,0

Software will soon be written mostly by AI SWEs working alongside humans. Codebases and the development environments around them will soon become living artifacts that can anticipate, maintain context on, and execute your every intention. Software development is rapidly evolving and key infrastructure like language servers must evolve with it to support a new generation of developer tools.<p>As part of Rift, we&#x27;re releasing an open-source VSCode extension which shows what is possible today with a language server that can mediate between LLMs and IDEs, and which takes a first step towards a future where you can build and iterate on entire projects with only natural language gestures.<p>Today, with Rift, you can do all of the following without ever leaving VSCode or copy-pasting from a browser chat window:<p>- Generate an entire workspace, or a module based on other parts of your codebase - Conversationally iterate on code edits over selected regions which are streamed directly into your editor window - Request, review, and iterate on codebase-wide, multi-file edits<p>Everything runs as an agent through Rift&#x27;s Agents API. You can define your own agents that can interact directly with your IDE and codebase through the language server, and can run arbitrary Python code that can do things like:<p>- provide a conversational UI over the git CLI (e.g. &#x27;suggest fixes for these merge conflicts, then rebase over myBranch&#x27;) - real-time automatic docstring generation triggered by saving a file or making a git commit - run tools like typecheckers and static analyzers in the background and implement fixes based on their output - automated code review in your IDE with context from GitHub<p>We&#x27;re proud to integrate with open-source projects like Smol Developer (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.github.com&#x2F;smol-ai&#x2F;developer"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.github.com&#x2F;smol-ai&#x2F;developer</a>), GPT Engineer (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.github.com&#x2F;antonosika&#x2F;gpt-engineer"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.github.com&#x2F;antonosika&#x2F;gpt-engineer</a>), and Aider (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.github.com&#x2F;paul-gauthier&#x2F;aider"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.github.com&#x2F;paul-gauthier&#x2F;aider</a>).<p>Language servers are ubiquitous and see every action you take in an IDE.

jallen_dot_dev,,37123863,6,"If you have tried GitHub&#x27;s Copilot Chat, then this will look familiar to you.<p>The main difference, however, is you can choose which LLM to talk to. So far OpenPilot supports GPT 3.5&#x2F;4 and Google PaLM 2. I&#x27;d like to add support for more models (Claude 2, etc) but have been stuck on waiting lists so I haven&#x27;t tested them.<p>OpenPilot will give context to your prompts by automatically including relevant files from your workspace. You don&#x27;t need to have the file open or manually highlight the code in question. It does this using 2 techniques:<p>1. All the files in your workspace are transformed into embeddings and stored in a DB (Chroma). When you enter a prompt, OpenPilot performs a similarity search to try to find the files you are talking about.<p>2. It uses a two-step process when communicating to the LLM. It first asks the LLM what files it needs to see in order to answer your prompt, passing along the file paths that matched. This lets the model confirm whether the files are really relevant, so we don&#x27;t pollute the context with irrelevant info. It also gives it a chance to specify any files that didn&#x27;t semantically match, which it might be able to infer exist based on your prompt and the structure of your project given the file paths it has seen. Finally, the prompt is resubmitted along with the contents of the files it asked for.<p>Another feature of OpenPilot that Copilot Chat doesn&#x27;t (yet) have is the ability to apply diffs. In Copilot Chat, you can insert code at your cursor position. I think OpenPilot&#x27;s diffs have more potential because you can 1) both add and remove lines, 2) make changes in multiple places, and 3) edit a file you don&#x27;t have open, or even multiple files.<p>Unfortunately, GPT 3.5 is pretty bad at formatting diffs, in my experience. This is why I&#x27;ve put it behind a toggle. Some work needs to be done here.<p>I would appreciate any feedback. If there is interest in this, I&#x27;d like to continue iterating on it. An obvious next step would be adding support for a locally-running LLM. Along with better strategies for finding relevant context, and better UX in general.

After the business plan is developed, it criticizes this plan recursively until the &quot;Investor&quot; prompt is satisfied with the plan. After all this it will generate the final MVP idea and pass it to a the React Engineer Agent I live coded 2 days ago (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jawerty&#x2F;10x-react-engineer"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jawerty&#x2F;10x-react-engineer</a>). Finally once the code is generated you have an option to pivot.<p>As for the AI&#x27;s memory, I have a small vector db for history of good intuition+idea examples to use as context (builds as you generate) and a simple backlog of business idea criticisms.<p>Overall, this experiment showed me that you definitely don&#x27;t need OpenAI keys to have an effective LLM Agent for you. This is only using the Llama 13b parameter chat model and doing a wonderful job. I spend maybe 5 dollars of Colab compute building this for 6 hours which is way more than it would be to mess around with this.<p>One caveat is the final react code base often needs some modifications to the package.json&#x2F;webpack setup. However, It&#x27;s generating the components&#x2F;folder surprisingly well starting from the entrypoint file.

swyx,,37200592,12,"Hi HN, we&#x27;re Sean, Alec, and swyx, and we&#x27;ve been hacking on this side project that harmonizes all the major AI chat apps (Closed LLMs, Open Source Hosted LLMs, and Local&#x2F;GGML ones too) and lets you invoke them in one keyboard shortcut.<p>I originally made this as a smol menubar app that could quickly access ChatGPT from wherever I was on desktop. This necessitated writing an Electron app, rather than a Chrome extension. I also didn&#x27;t have access to the GPT-4 API at the time, so I preferred to use GPT-4 via the full webapp.<p>Then Bing came out strong, and Bard, and Claude, and Llama, and Vicuna, and Falcon and on and on, and other people kept reporting amazing SOTA results on model after model and I felt hopelessly behind - either you just take benchmark results at face value, or you spend serious time copying and pasting chats just to get a feel for the practical differences between the various closed&#x2F;open source LLMs.<p>The real value came when I started just running every query past 3-5 chats at once, and started getting a sense for what each was good at. Bing&#x2F;You.com is (obviously) good at search, but so is Perplexity. Claude 2 wins about 30% of my code queries vs GPT4. GPT4 and Bard and Bing handle file uploads differently. Llama2 is surprisingly good sometimes but also hopelessly bad at others. And so on. But the answer isn&#x27;t to pick one daily driver. It&#x27;s to make it easy to just run them all at once, and swap in&#x2F;out whenever necessary.<p>(I&#x27;ve taken to calling this Mixture of Mixture of Experts, akin to the GPT4 rumors geohot dropped on our podcast <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=36413296"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=36413296</a>)<p>As the app grew in screen real estate (ultrawide monitor people! this is your calling!) and I started needing to copy&#x2F;paste things more, I realized what we were really building was a full-fledged <i>secondary browser</i> that does a slightly different job than your regular browser. It&#x27;s nominal first purpose is to just harmonize all chat inputs, but more broadly, I can pipe any arbitrary input to any open&#x2F;closed LLM <i>without any api key</i> using your own account, and use it to enhance your browsing experience generally without me ever seeing your data. What could you do if you could add intelligence features for ~free to any part of your browsing experience? MS Edge has shown a bit of this potential but why should we be limited to just the Edge browser, or just the sidebar? (you can see the beginnings of our thinking in the alpha PromptCritic feature we just added).<p>You can see our 1min launch video here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;swyx&#x2F;status&#x2F;1692988634364871032"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;swyx&#x2F;status&#x2F;1692988634364871032</a><p>We&#x27;ve been hacking on this as a side project, and it&#x27;s my first ever Electron app using a bunch of gnarly features.

We are excited to open source Dataherald’s natural-language-to-SQL engine today (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Dataherald&#x2F;dataherald"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Dataherald&#x2F;dataherald</a>). This engine allows you to set up an API from your structured database that can answer questions in plain English.<p>GPT-4 class LLMs have gotten remarkably good at writing SQL. However, out-of-the-box LLMs and existing frameworks would not work with our own structured data at a necessary quality level. For example, given the question “what was the average rent in Los Angeles in May 2023?” a reasonable human would either assume the question is about Los Angeles, CA or would confirm the state with the question asker in a follow up. However, an LLM translates this to:<p>select price from rent_prices where city=”Los Angeles” AND month=”05” AND year=”2023”<p>This pulls data for Los Angeles, CA and Los Angeles, TX without getting columns to differentiate between the two. You can read more about the challenges of enterprise-level text-to-SQL in this blog post I wrote on the topic: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;dataherald&#x2F;why-enterprise-natural-language-to-sql-is-hard-8849414f41c"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;dataherald&#x2F;why-enterprise-natural-languag...</a><p>Dataherald comes with “batteries-included.” It has best-in-class implementations of core components, including, but not limited to: a state of the art NL-to-SQL agent, an LLM-based SQL-accuracy evaluator. The architecture is modular, allowing these components to be easily replaced. It’s easy to set up and use with major data warehouses.<p>There is a “Context Store” where information (NL2SQL examples, schemas and table descriptions) is used for the LLM prompts to make the engine get better with usage. And we even made it fast!<p>This version allows you to easily connect to PG, Databricks, BigQuery or Snowflake and set up an API for semantic interactions with your structured data. You can then add business and data context that are used for few-shot prompting by the engine.<p>The NL-to-SQL agent in this open source release was developed by our own Mohammadreza Pourreza, whose DIN-SQL algorithm is currently top of the Spider (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yale-lily.github.io&#x2F;spider"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yale-lily.github.io&#x2F;spider</a>) and Bird (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bird-bench.github.io&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bird-bench.github.io&#x2F;</a>) NL 2 SQL benchmarks. This agent has outperformed the Langchain SQLAgent anywhere from 12%-250%.5x (depending on the provided context) in our own internal benchmarking while being only ~15s slower on average.<p>Needless to say, this is an early release and the codebase is under swift development.

marcklingen,,37310070,143,"Hi HN! Langfuse is OSS observability and analytics for LLM applications (repo: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;langfuse&#x2F;langfuse"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;langfuse&#x2F;langfuse</a>, 2 min demo: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;langfuse.com&#x2F;video"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;langfuse.com&#x2F;video</a>, try it yourself: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;langfuse.com&#x2F;demo"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;langfuse.com&#x2F;demo</a>)<p>Langfuse makes capturing and viewing LLM calls (execution traces) a breeze. On top of this data, you can analyze the quality, cost and latency of LLM apps.<p>When GPT-4 dropped, we started building LLM apps – a lot of them! [1, 2] But they all suffered from the same issue: it’s hard to assure quality in 100% of cases and even to have a clear view of user behavior. Initially, we logged all prompts&#x2F;completions to our production database to understand what works and what doesn’t. We soon realized we needed more context, more data and better analytics to sustainably improve our apps.  So we started building a homegrown tool.<p>Our first task was to track and view what is going on in production: what user input is provided, how prompt templates or vector db requests work, and which steps of an LLM chain fail. We built async SDKs and a slick frontend to render chains in a nested way. It’s a good way to look at LLM logic ‘natively’. Then we added some basic analytics to understand token usage and quality over time for the entire project or single users (pre-built dashboards).<p>Under the hood, we use the T3 stack (Typescript, NextJs, Prisma, tRPC, Tailwind, NextAuth), which allows us to move fast + it means it&#x27;s easy to contribute to our repo. The SDKs are heavily influenced by the design of the PostHog SDKs [3] for stable implementations of async network requests. It was a surprisingly inconvenient experience to convert OpenAPI specs to boilerplate Python code and we ended up using Fern [4] here. We’re fans of Tailwind + shadcn&#x2F;ui + tremor.so for speed and flexibility in building tables and dashboards fast.<p>Our SDKs run fully asynchronously and make network requests in the background. We did our best to reduce any impact on application performance to a minimum. We never block the main execution path.<p>We&#x27;ve made two engineering decisions we&#x27;ve felt uncertain about: to use a Postgres database and Looker Studio for the analytics MVP. Supabase performs well at our scale and integrates seamlessly into our tech stack. We will need to move to an OLAP database soon and are debating if we need to start batching ingestion and if we can keep using Vercel. Any experience you could share would be helpful!<p>Integrating Looker Studio got us to first analytics charts in half a day. As it is not open-source and does not work with our UI&#x2F;UX, we are looking to switch it out for an OSS solution to flexibly generate charts and dashboards. We’ve had a look at Lightdash and would be happy to hear your thoughts.<p>We’re borrowing our OSS business model from Posthog&#x2F;Supabase who make it easy to self-host with features reserved for enterprise (no plans yet) and a paid version for managed cloud service. Right now all of our code is available under a permissive license (MIT).<p>Next, we’re going deep on analytics. For quality specifically, we will build out model-based evaluations and labeling to be able to cluster traces by scores and use cases.<p>Looking forward to hearing your thoughts and discussion – we’ll be in the comments.

There is no drag and drop graph, you simply create components that you want to use in your bot. We currently have chat and document components.<p>Chat components allow you to generate chat completions.

In the process, we learned how hard it is to sell a horizontal SaaS platform. That combined with the concerns around data privacy (both with us hosting data as well sending data to model providers like OpenAI), we found a lot of enterprises hesitant to signup for Promptly. We added the ability for the users to host their own vector databases which helped a bit. With the current pace of performance improvements in open source LLMs, enterprises now have the ability to run LLMs entirely locally or in their private clouds without suffering the loss in quality of output. This made us realize we can make Promptly self-hostable so enterprises can have a low-code apps platform on locally running LLMs without sending any data out. LLMStack came out of this realization.<p>Promptly is now powered by LLMStack which is entirely being developed in the open. Anyone can bring up LLMStack locally and have an experience similar to Promptly. We still have paid plans on Promptly for customers who don&#x27;t want to deal with installations and offer on-prem installation support to enterprises that want to use LLMStack similar to Supabase, Airbyte etc. Our current focus with LLMStack is to make it work really well with open-source models.

Art_F_T_Machine,,37370815,2,"Mantella is a Skyrim mod which allows you to have natural conversations with NPCs using your voice by leveraging Whisper for speech-to-text, LLMs for text generation, and xVASynth for text-to-speech.<p>The mod composes of two parts:<p>1. An exe written in Python which is used to connect the various components together (Whisper &#x2F; LLM &#x2F; xVASynth &#x2F; NPC background descriptions). See here for the code: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;art-from-the-machine&#x2F;Mantella"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;art-from-the-machine&#x2F;Mantella</a><p>2. A Skyrim Papyrus mod which both reads out voicelines generated via the exe and passes in-game information to the exe (the NPC selected &#x2F; in-game events). The code can be found in Files -&gt; Mantella Spell here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nexusmods.com&#x2F;skyrimspecialedition&#x2F;mods&#x2F;98631"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nexusmods.com&#x2F;skyrimspecialedition&#x2F;mods&#x2F;98631</a><p>The mod supports local (eg Llama 2), OpenAI (eg GPT-4), and OpenRouter (eg Claude v2) language models. NPC memories are handled by recursively summarising previous conversations. When a given conversation is ended, the conversation is passed to the LLM with the task of summarising the conversation in a short paragraph. This paragraph is saved to a text file along with all previous conversation summaries. If the text file itself reaches the LLM&#x27;s token limit, the full conversation history is then re-summarised and the process begins again. This means that the &quot;lucidity&quot; of NPC memories is tied to the token length of the model used (LLMs with lower token limits will need to re-summarise memories more often). I have also subjectively noticed that the ability to recall memories depends on the LLM (eg GPT-3.5 vs GPT-4).<p>Mantella contains over 1,000+ NPC background descriptions which are passed to the LLM within the starting prompt to help it &quot;get in character&quot;. This gives the LLM a head start, but from my testing &#x2F; other user reports models like GPT-3.5 already contain lots of data related to Skyrim lore and its characters to work with. It will sometimes get details wrong, but for the most part this doesn&#x27;t break the experience.<p>The performance of the mod will vary depending on your hardware and chosen setup. xVASynth and Whisper are run locally, and the chosen LLM can either be run locally or via an API. When I run Mantella via the OpenAI API I have an average response time of ~5 seconds on my 5800x3D CPU. You can also run each component on your GPU, but since I run Skyrim in VR the drop in frames is too much of a sacrifice for shorter response times.<p>With the &quot;how&quot; covered, I want to also touch on why I started this project. Skyrim in VR feels incredibly immersive and realistic, and the reason I started working on this mod was because I felt like unique dialogue was the missing puzzle piece to complete the experience. By having NPCs I can talk to over long journeys, or react to the things I have done and treat me differently, or remember me from my last visit to their town that I might not even remember, it builds up this narrative over time that is unique to me.<p>Another reason I started this project is because I am interested in seeing what is possible &#x2F; what are the limits of these different technologies. While this passion project is a mod for a video game released in 2011, I can&#x27;t wait to see what developers building games from the ground up with this technology in mind can achieve. I also hope that Mantella gives an idea of how such a system could be implemented in newly released games. While AAA studios could possibly pull off charging users on a monthly basis to use these services, indie developers might have a harder time achieving this. I hope that Mantella provides insight into what is possible when running everything completely offline. Local models are constantly improving, and I can&#x27;t wait to see how these improvements continue. Overall I am incredibly excited to see where this kind of technology goes in the future!<p>Mantella Trailer:   <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;FLmbd48r2Wo?si=QLe2_E1CogpxlaS1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;FLmbd48r2Wo?si=QLe2_E1CogpxlaS1</a>",1693752136,2023-09-03 14:42:16 UTC,Show HN: Mantella – Talk to AI-Powered NPCs in Skyrim,story,https://github.com/art-from-the-machine/Mantella,3/9/2023 14:42,26,14,9,12,16,2,63,13,11,14,54,17,38,33,6,31,47,27,4,2,5,10,4,2,4,3,3,6,6,3

kamiljk,,37400570,4,"Hey HN! Trellis is an open-source framework for programmatically orchestrating LLM workflows as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) in Python.<p>My friend and I started working on this a few weeks ago after we tried building applications using mainstream LLM frameworks, and faced all the common complaints (too abstracted, hard to customize, bad docs&#x2F;support). After talking to a few other people building with LLMs, we also noticed that these frameworks were not inherently built to support DAG-based LLM workflows.<p>We designed Trellis to be as minimal and flat as possible, so developers can have lower level control over their DAGs. Trellis is composed of only three abstractions: Node, DAG, and LLM.<p>Node: the atomic unit of Trellis. Nodes are chained together to form a DAG. Node is an abstract class with only one method required to implement.<p>DAG: a directed acyclic graph of Nodes. It is the primary abstraction for orchestrating LLM workflows. When you add edges between Nodes, you can specify a transformation function to reuse Nodes and connect any two Nodes. Trellis verifies the data flowing between Nodes in a DAG to ensure the flow of data is validated.<p>LLM: a wrapper around a large language model with simple catches for common OpenAI errors. Currently, the only provider that Trellis supports is OpenAI.<p>Check out our docs if this sounds interesting: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;interlocklabsinc.mintlify.app&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;introduction"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;interlocklabsinc.mintlify.app&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;introduc...</a><p>We&#x27;d love it if you tried hacking with it and give us any feedback you have! :)",1693965864,2023-09-06 02:04:24 UTC,Show HN: Trellis – open-source Python framework to build DAG-based LLM workflows,story,https://github.com/interlocklabs/trellis,6/9/2023 2:04,23,4,0,0,3,3,10,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0
razcle,,37403446,3,"Hi HN,<p>We’re Raza and Jordan, the founders of Humanloop. At our company hackathon, we built an initial prototype for an extensible AI assistant that lives in Slack.<p>ChatGPT is incredibly useful. But it’s also very limited. It doesn’t have the context of your work or your company. It can’t take actions beyond sending you messages in text. It has no memory.<p>That’s why we built Coworker. Coworker is a GPT-4 powered assistant that lives in Slack. It&#x27;s not like normal AI assistants though. Instead of being a chatbot, it sits in the background and reads each message in context. Then, it if thinks it can help it sends the user a message, gets approvals and then takes action.<p>To make Coworker, we made heavy use of GPT-4‘s function calling. There’s a central decision-making agent that reads every message and takes action by outputting a “function call”. This is a JSON object that specifics what the agent wants to do — whether that’s messaging the user or making an API call. After the agent asks to do an action, we get a confirmation from the user and then execute the API call.<p>A crucial part of a good coworker is that you can teach them to do new things. We&#x27;ve made it easy for you extend the capability of Coworker, all you have to do is write a Python function with a good docstring and save it to the “tools” folder. Over time, your team can add more and more capabilities that seem relevant.<p>We chose to do this in Slack because it&#x27;s an incredible repository of company information. The AI can understand the context of your work. It’s also a place where important information gets shared but also lost. Coworker can really help with this. For example, if someone in your company mentions a bug in Slack, Coworker will offer to create a Linear ticket.<p>We built Coworker in Python using OpenAI GPT-4, Humanloop and the Slack API. To deploy the bot we used Railway.app. This is the result of a 24-hour hackathon but we really hope to keep working on it and make it something genuinely useful both to us at Humanloop and to the wider community. Our GitHub repo contains ideas for extending it.<p>Would love your feedback, ideas and contributions!<p>Warm wishes,<p>Raza and Jordan",1693997847,2023-09-06 10:57:27 UTC,Show HN: Coworker – An Open Source AI assistant for your company Slack,story,https://github.com/humanloop/coworker,6/9/2023 10:57,17,4,0,0,0,1,12,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,1,0

This adaptation can train the model (using QLoRA) to respond in a way that&#x27;s eerily similar to your own texting style.<p>What I&#x27;ve figured out so far:<p>Quick Learning: The model quickly adapts to personal nuances, emoji usage, and phrases that you use. I&#x27;ve trained just 1 epoch on a P100 GPU using QLoRA and 4 bit quantization, and its already captured my mannerisms<p>Turing Tests: As an experiment, I asked my friends to ask me 3 questions, and responded with 2 candidate responses (one from me and one from llama). My friends then had to guess which candidate response was mine and which one was Llama&#x27;s. Llama managed to fool 10% of my friends, but with more compute, I think it can do way better.<p>Here&#x27;s the GitHub repository: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Ads-cmu&#x2F;WhatsApp-Llama&#x2F;"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Ads-cmu&#x2F;WhatsApp-Llama&#x2F;</a><p>Would love to hear feedback, suggestions, and any cool experiences if you decide to give it a try!

Saw a plethora of tools coming out as we witness here every week. I&#x27;d broadly categorize them into the GUI drag-and-drop variety, and the airflow and MLflow competitors pivoting. Not counting experiment dumps.<p>My opinions kind of differed from these. The thesis that I chose to work with, is based on Conway’s law - the tooling for building agents must accommodate various team, communication structures and expertise available in an org. This scheme could only work if the tooling itself was more of a thin infrastructure glue layer supporting loosely coupled components such that each component could be built, tested, deployed and re-used independently while leveraging the context and expertise of the ones building them. Also these components need to be &quot;Write once, run anywhere&quot;.<p>## Scheme<p>1. Developers build components relevant to their infrastructure and services.<p>2. ML engineers and data scientists get to work on data massaging, prompt engineering and model training without having to build data ingestion pipelines from whatever database engineering teams or whatever service product may be using.<p>3. Devops could deploy these components in their choice of runner (e.g. k8s) and orchestrate with their choice of orchestrator (e.g. airflow).<p>4. Product, engineers or whoever could take these components and compose them into workflows, experiment, test, then hand over to devops to deploy.<p>5. Some of these components end up as open source, and benefit the entire community.<p>Whichever of the above layer is not available, well, that’s where our open source modules kick in For example, no data science team? Use our standard huggingface components.<p>Thus, the builders build, the users use, and open source plugs in the holes.<p>The framework enables EVERYONE, without getting in the way.<p>## Community and Future<p>Guys, this is for you, and I want to make it useful. Some feedback would be nice, and it would help me create a better roadmap.

olokobayusuf,,37695530,360,"Hey all,<p>You&#x27;ve probably seen projects that add objects to an image from a style or text prompt, like InteriorAI (levelsio) and Adobe Firefly. The prevalent issue with these diffusion-based inpainting approaches is that they don&#x27;t yet have great conditioning on lighting, perspective, and structure. You&#x27;ll often get incorrect or generic shadows; warped-looking objects; and distorted backgrounds.<p>What is Fill 3D? Fill 3D is an exploration on doing generative fill in 3D to render ultra-realistic results that harmonize with the background image, using industry-standard path tracing, akin to compositing in Hollywood movies.<p>How does it work? 1. Deproject: First, deproject an image to a 3D shell using both geometric and photometric cues from the input image. 2. Place: Draw rectangles and describe what you want in them, akin to Photoshop&#x27;s Generative Fill feature. 3. Render: Use good ol&#x27; path tracing to render ultra-realistic results.<p>Why Fill 3D? + The results are insanely realistic (see video in the github repo, or on the website). + Fast enough: Currently, generations take 40-80 seconds. Diffusion takes ~10seconds, so we&#x27;re slower, but for the level of realism, it&#x27;s pretty good. + Potential applications: I&#x27;m thinking of virtual staging in real estate media, what do you think?<p>Check it out at <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fill3d.ai"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fill3d.ai</a> + There&#x27;s API access! :D + Right now, you need an image of an empty room.

eigenvalue,,37720704,6,"This project originally started out with a focus on easily generating embeddings from Llama2 and other llama_cpp (gguf) models and storing them in a database, all exposed via a convenient REST api (hence why it was originally called the not-very-catchy name of &quot;llama_embeddings_fastapi_service&quot; when I submitted it a few weeks ago).<p>But since then, I&#x27;ve added a lot more functionality:<p>1) New endpoint for generating text completions (including specifying custom grammars, like JSON).<p>2) Get all the embeddings for an entire document--can be any kind of document (plaintext, PDFs, doc&#x2F;.docx, etc.) and it will do OCR on PDFs and images.<p>3) Submit an audio file (wav&#x2F;mp3) and it uses whisper to transcribe it into text, then gets the embeddings for the text (after combining the transcription segments into complete sentences).<p>4) Integrates with my new vector similarity library (pip install fast_vector_similarity) to provide an &quot;advanced&quot; semantic search endpoint. This uses a 2-step process: first it uses FAISS to quickly narrow down the set of stored embeddings us cosine similarity, then it uses my vector similarity library to compute a bunch of more sophisticated (and computationally intensive) measures for the final ranking.<p>5) An endpoint to view the application logs in a nice web view with helpful coloring, with the ability to download the logs or copy to the clipboard.<p>6) And endpoint to add a new model file by supplying the URL to the model (e.g., a Huggingface URL). Previously, you had to manually edit a function in the code to add a new model.<p>As a result of all these additions, I changed the project name to Swiss Army Llama to reflect the new project goal: to be a one-stop-shop for all your local LLM needs, so you can easily integrate this technology in your programming projects. As I think of more useful endpoints to add (I constantly get new feature ideas from my own separate projects-- whenever I want to do something that isn&#x27;t covered yet, I add a new endpoint or option), I will continue growing the scope of the project. So let me know if there is some functionality that you think would be generally useful, or at least extremely useful for you!<p>A big part of what makes this project useful to me is the FastAPI backbone. Nothing beats a simple REST API with a well-documented Swagger page for ease and familiarity, especially for developers who aren&#x27;t familiar with LLMs. You can set this up in 1 minute on a fresh box using the docker TLDR commands, come back in 15 minutes, and it&#x27;s all set up with downloaded models (I include and ready to do inference or get embeddings.

They aim to dramatically improve the quality, depth, nuance, and utility of all ChatGPT responses.<p>Both of them instruct ChatGPT to begin its completion with a preamble designed to take advantage of how the attention mechanism attends to recent tokens. They relieve the user of having to determine a task-specific prompt, and turn even the simplest questions into high quality context for ChatGPT to attend to.<p>The first (“Standard Edition”) is for both free and paid ChatGPT subscribers. While it naturally works much better for GPT-4, it does show marked improvement for reasoning and planning, even with GPT-3.5. It automatically determines the best role to adopt, incorporates Google search links (GPT-4 is hallucination free; GPT-3.5 is, well, <i>better</i>), and ends each response with an “epilogue” with links to related and tangential content that the user might enjoy digging in to.<p>The “Developer Edition” is perfect for anyone using ChatGPT’s pro subscription (GPT-4 + Advanced Data Analysis), and comes with a companion Python script that you upload at the beginning of each chat. It adds &#x2F;slash commands to help stash&#x2F;recall text (perfect for reminding ChatGPT about your stack), building ctags (which you can ask ChatGPT to reference when writing or editing more complex code), and backing up all your files and session memory to a zip file that you can upload to a new chat to pick up where you left off. You can even upload wheels to extend the sandbox capabilities.<p>Like the “Standard Edition”, the “Developer Edition” instructs ChatGPT to begin its completion with a preamble that takes advantage of positional and semantic attention heads, influencing the quality of its generated code. The epilogue includes a brief history, as well as a simplified source&#x2F;symbol tree, making it much less likely to forget what it’s been doing.<p>It even does a great job of creating complete code, by automatically adding &#x2F;&#x2F; TODO comments for itself, and generating code over multiple chat turns.<p>Check them out, and tell me what you think.<p>EDIT: I think some folks here might be particularly interested to check out how &#x2F;slash commands were implemented. The technique used in the companion script is a great way to extend ChatGPT’s normally limited space for a “system prompt”, and can easily be adopted to do prompt chaining. I’m wrapping up another script that acts like a sort of “setup wizard”, guiding first-time users through creating a YAML file describing their stack, preferences, etc. through a series of chained prompts.

Setup takes a couple of lines of code, and then you can call text and image models from your Javascript frontend. It also includes a vector store so you can easily add semantic context to your calls with embeddings.<p>We have more things in the SDK Library like a Chat abstraction with automatic long term memory, DataLoader (e.g. to load text or audio files) and a system to turn prompt in environment variables.

JackHopkins,,38277248,95,"Hi HN, Jack here! I&#x27;m one of the creators of MonkeyPatch, an easy tool that helps you build LLM-powered functions and apps that get cheaper and faster the more you use them.<p>For example, if you need to classify PDFs, extract product feedback from tweets, or auto-generate synthetic data, you can spin up an LLM-powered Python function in &lt;5 minutes to power your application. Unlike existing LLM clients, these functions generate well-typed outputs with guardrails to mitigate unexpected behavior.<p>After about 200-300 calls, these functions will begin to get cheaper and faster. We&#x27;ve seen 8-10x reduction in cost and latency in some use-cases! This happens via progressive knowledge distillation - MonkeyPatch incrementally fine-tunes smaller, cheaper models in the background, tests them against the constraints defined by the developer, and retains the smallest model that meets accuracy requirements, which typically has significantly lower costs and latency.<p>As an LLM researcher, I kept getting asked by startups and friends to build specific LLM features that they could embed into their applications. I realized that most developers have to either 1) use existing low-level LLM clients (GPT4&#x2F;Claude), which can be unreliable, untyped, and pricey, or 2) pore through LangChain documentation for days to build something.<p>We built MonkeyPatch to make it easy for developers to inject LLM-powered functions into their code and create tests to ensure they behave as intended. Our goal is to help developers easily build apps and functions without worrying about reliability, cost, and latency, while following best software engineering practices.<p>We&#x27;re only available in Python currently but actively working on a Typescript version. The repo has all the instructions you need to get up and running in a few minutes.<p>The world of LLMs is changing by the day and so we&#x27;re not 100% sure how MonkeyPatch will evolve. For now, I&#x27;m just excited to share what we&#x27;ve been working on with the HN community.

picohen,,38368570,155,"Over the last couple months we have been supporting developers in building large-scale RAG pipelines to process millions of pieces of data.<p>We documented our approach in an HN post (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37824547"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37824547</a>) a couple weeks ago. Today, we are open sourcing the framework we have developed.<p>The framework focuses on RAG data pipelines and provides scale, reliability, and data synchronization capabilities out of the box.<p>For those newer to RAG, it is a technique to provide context to Large Language Models. It consists of grabbing pieces of information (i.e. pieces of news articles, papers, descriptions, etc.) and incorporating them into prompts to help contextualize the responses. The technique goes one level deeper in finding the right pieces of information to incorporate. The search for relevant information is done through the use of vector embeddings and vector databases.<p>Those pieces of news articles, papers, etc. are transformed into a vector embedding that represents the semantic meaning of the information. These vector representations are organized into indexes where we can quickly search for the pieces of information that most closely resembles (from a semantic perspective) a given question or query. For example, if I take news articles from this year, vectorize them, and add them to an index, I can quickly search for pieces of information about the US elections.<p>To help achieve this, the Neum AI framework features:<p>Starting with built-in data connectors for common data sources, embedding services and vector stores, the framework provides modularity to build data pipelines to your specification.<p>The connectors support pre-processing capabilities to define loading, chunking and selecting strategies to optimize content to be embedded. This also includes extracting metadata that is going to be associated to a given vector.<p>The generated pipelines support large scale jobs through a high throughput distributed architecture. The connectors allow you to parallelize tasks like downloading documents, processing them, generating embedding and ingesting data into the vector DB.<p>For data sources that might be continuously changing, the framework supports data scheduling and synchronization. This includes delta syncs where only new data is pulled.<p>Once data is transformed into a vector database, the framework supports querying of the data including hybrid search using the available metadata added during pre-processing. As part of the querying process, the framework provides capabilities to capture feedback on retrieved data as well as run evaluations against different pipeline configurations.<p>Try it out and if interested in chatting more about this shoot us an email founders@tryneum.com",1700594429,2023-11-21 19:20:29 UTC,Show HN: Neum AI – Open-source large-scale RAG framework,story,https://github.com/NeumTry/NeumAI,21/11/2023 19:20,89,44,21,25,22,14,47,16,0,0,0,0,24,16,0,0,0,0,4,2,2,2,0,1,5,4,0,0,0,0

It transforms your favorite database into an AI development and deployment environment (𝘮𝘢𝘬𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘪𝘵 𝘴𝘶𝘱𝘦𝘳-𝘥𝘶𝘱𝘦𝘳).<p>SuperDuperDB eliminates complex MLOps pipelines, specialized vector databases - and the need to migrate and duplicate data by integrating AI at the data&#x27;s source, directly on top of your existing data infrastructure. This massively simplifies building and managing AI applications.<p>SuperDuperDB provides a simple Python interface, but allows experts to drill down to any level of implementation detail such as models weights or training details.<p>Today’s release comes with the full integration of major SQL databases as well as further MongoDB support: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, DuckDB, Snowflake, BigQuery, ClickHouse, DataFusion, Druid, Impala, MSSQL, Oracle, pandas, Polars, PySpark, and Trino.<p>Currently Supported AI: Any model from PyTorch, Sklearn, HuggingFace as well as AI APIs such as OpenAI, Anthrophic, Cohere.<p>A few useful links: - Our website: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;superduperdb.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;superduperdb.com</a> - Getting started docs: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.superduperdb.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;category&#x2F;get-started&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.superduperdb.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;category&#x2F;get-started&#x2F;</a> - Our repo on Github: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;SuperDuperDB&#x2F;superduperdb"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;SuperDuperDB&#x2F;superduperdb</a><p>Check the uses-cases that we have already implemented here  <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.superduperdb.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;category&#x2F;use-cases"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.superduperdb.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;category&#x2F;use-cases</a> as well as apps built by the community here  <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;SuperDuperDB&#x2F;superduper-community-apps"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;SuperDuperDB&#x2F;superduper-community-apps</a> and try all of them with Jupyter your browser  <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;demo.superduperdb.com&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;demo.superduperdb.com&#x2F;</a><p>For more information about SuperDuperDB and why we believe it is much needed, read the blog post   <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.superduperdb.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;superduperdb-the-open-source-framework-for-bringing-ai-to-your-datastore&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.superduperdb.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;superduperdb-the-open-sou...</a><p>We are keen to hear your feedback!<p>All the best, Timo",1701782410,2023-12-05 13:20:10 UTC,Show HN: SuperDuperDB – Open-source framework for integrating AI with databases,story,https://github.com/SuperDuperDB/superduperdb,5/12/2023 13:20,2996,347,169,104,112,92,165,71,70,72,107,94,145,81,69,67,100,81,318,38,23,20,20,12,23,11,6,9,11,8

Sometimes the JSON output doesn’t return all the required fields, and once in a while it returns empty strings as part of values…<p>- I love that LLMs sometimes outputs crazy things for the tamagotchi.

I want to build an OSS version of Azure OpenAI services that people could self host in their own infrastructure.<p>&quot;How can I track LLM spend per API key?&quot;<p>&quot;Can I create a development OpenAI API key with limited access for Bob?&quot;<p>&quot;Can I see my LLM spend breakdown by models and endpoints?&quot;<p>&quot;Can I create 100 OpenAI API keys that my students could use in a classroom setting?&quot;<p>These are questions that BricksLLM helps you answer.<p>BricksLLM is an API gateway that let you create API keys with rate limit, cost control and ttl that could be used to access all OpenAI and Anthropic endpoints with out of box analytics.<p>When I first started building with OpenAI APIs, I was constantly worried about API keys being comprised since vanilla OpenAI API keys would grant you unlimited access to all of their models. There are stories of people losing thousands of dollars and the existence of a black market for stolen OpenAI API keys.<p>This is why I started building a proxy for ourselves that allows for the creation of API keys with rate limits and cost controls. I built BricksLLM in Go since that was the language I used to build performative ads exchanges that scaled to thousands of requests per second at my previous job. A lot of developer tools in LLM ops are built with Python which I believe might be suboptimal in terms of performance and compute resource efficiency.<p>One of the challenges building this platform is to get accurate token counts for different OpenAI and Anthropic models. LLM providers are not exactly transparent with the way how they count prompt and completion tokens. In addition to user input, OpenAI and Anthropic pad prompt inputs with additional instructions or phrases that contribute to the final token counts. For example, Anthropic&#x27;s actual completion token consumption is consistently 4 more than the token count of the completion output.<p>The latency of the gateway hovers around 50ms. Half of the latency comes from the tokenizer. If I start utilizing Go routines, might be able to lower the latency of the gateway to 30ms.<p>BricksLLM is not an observability platform, but we do provide integration with Datadog so you can get more insights regarding what is going on inside the proxy. Compared to other tools in the LLMOps space, I believe that BricksLLM has the most comprehensive features when it comes to access control.<p>Let me know what you guys think.",1702320983,2023-12-11 18:56:23 UTC,Show HN: I built an OSS alternative to Azure OpenAI services,story,https://github.com/bricks-cloud/BricksLLM,11/12/2023 18:56,503,47,31,26,46,35,28,16,20,46,50,26,18,3,7,4,0,16,22,5,2,5,4,5,5,2,3,2,1,3

inaciom,,38617200,7,"Hi HN! RΞASON is an OSS Typescript framework for developing LLM apps that uses Typescript&#x27;s interfaces to get structured output from an LLM.<p>While there are other TS LLM frameworks, I think RΞASON fills a unique space in the market: it&#x27;s laser-focused on only three areas and, most importantly, actively stays away from pre-made prompting &amp; retrieval.<p>I&#x27;ve been in the LLM space since GPT-3 originally came out, and I&#x27;ve always had problems with other frameworks, such as LangChain. I dislike that they focus a ton on out-of-the-box prompting &amp; pre-made agents — <i>I</i>, as the dev, should be the one in charge of it.<p>My belief is that LLMs are a new primitive that programmers can use — not a new way to program; it&#x27;s still up to the programmer to do the right thing &amp; create the right abstractions. Therefore, it&#x27;s the developer&#x27;s job to learn the new concepts that come from this new primitive, such as prompting &amp; retrieval. I see a similar analogy here with ORMs &amp; SQL.<p>What RΞASON helps with is in areas that don&#x27;t differentiate your app: getting structured outputs, handling streaming, and observability.<p>The goal of RΞASON is to make creating great LLM experiences easier. We try to accomplish this by simplifying the hard stuff &amp; maximizing performance — decreasing as much as possible the TTUB.<p>RΞASON is OpenTelemetry compatible — which allows observability in almost any tool (Zipkin, Jaeger, paid solutions, etc.).<p>I&#x27;d really love to hear feedback about RΞASON! It has been a hobby project for the last months and I&#x27;m super curious to what y&#x27;all will think.<p>By the way, contributions welcome!",1702409718,2023-12-12 19:35:18 UTC,Show HN: RΞASON – Open-source TypeScript framework for LLM apps,story,https://github.com/try-reason/reason,12/12/2023 19:35,36,4,2,2,3,0,17,2,3,0,0,0,8,4,4,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0

Dependency on a single model risked total downtime. 2. Latency issues with models like GPT-4 affected user experience. 3. Integrating various models was tough due to different APIs and SDKs.<p>Early this year at Writesonic, we set out with a clear vision: to become model agnostic.<p>Faced with single-model limitations and diverse AI challenges, we began building GPTRouter - our bespoke solution to navigate and thrive in a multi-model AI world.<p>With GPTRouter&#x27;s Universal API, you&#x27;re the master of AI models. Swap between OpenAI, Azure, Anthropic, Replicate, Cohere &amp; more with just one line of code. It simplifies model management to a great extent.<p>Downtime isn&#x27;t an option. GPTRouter&#x27;s Smart Fallbacks mean your service is always on. You can define a hierarchy of models for each use case. GPTRouter will constantly check for uptime&#x2F;downtime, latency and other factors, and automatically fallback to the next best model with zero interruption.<p>Say goodbye to manual retries. GPTRouter does the heavy lifting with Automatic Retries for failed requests, keeping your AI services sharp and consistent.<p>GPTRouter&#x27;s Edge:  Universal API for seamless model switching.  Smart, automatic fallbacks for continuous service.  Reduced latencies for quick interactions.<p>Additionally, we will also be open sourcing our frontend LLMOps layer that provides a playground to test multiple models in parallel, keep a tab on the latencies for each model, track tokens and costs for each model and user all in one place.<p>We are looking forward to seeing how developers leverage GPTRouter in their own use cases.<p>Thank you!",1703251472,2023-12-22 13:24:32 UTC,"Show HN: GPT Router – Open-Source API Gateway for LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)",story,https://github.com/Writesonic/GPTRouter,22/12/2023 13:24,42,16,19,23,11,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,4,0,0,0,3,0,1,0,3,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

I&#x27;m a backend developer with a penchant for Node.js and SQL, and I&#x27;ve been wrestling with a problem that&#x27;s both technically intricate and surprisingly common in the world of open-source development.<p>The issue at hand? Duplicate GitHub issues. They&#x27;re like weeds in a garden – you turn your back for a second, and suddenly they&#x27;re everywhere, choking out the valuable discussions and dragging down productivity.<p>So, I set out to build a bot. Not just any bot, mind you, but a Probot GitHub app that could intelligently detect and flag duplicates before they multiplied. It was a problem that scratched my own itch, and I figured if it worked for me, it might just work for others too.<p>The idea was simple enough: whenever a new issue is opened, the bot would compare it against existing issues using OpenAI&#x27;s embeddings to measure textual similarity. But the simplicity was deceptive. I needed to store and query embeddings efficiently, which led me down the rabbit hole of Supabase and its vector extension. I had to learn the nuances of vector similarity, and let me tell you, it&#x27;s a topic that can get as thorny as the problem it&#x27;s trying to solve.<p>As I iterated on the solution, I discovered nuances I hadn&#x27;t anticipated. The importance of metadata like issue labels, repo id, issue id and so on, for example. The need to account  The fact that the bot needed to be able to handle multiple repos, each with their own set of issues. The list goes on, so I focused on the simplest possible solution that could still be effective. I wanted to build something that would be useful to the community, not just a technical exercise.<p>I&#x27;m proud of the bot I built. its solves the task of detecting duplicates with a high degree of accuracy, and it&#x27;s open-source so anyone can use it. Also if you have existing issues the sync script will sync them to the database so you can start detecting duplicates right away.<p>For those who love the gritty details: I leveraged TypeScript for its type safety, wrangled with SQL functions to handle vector operations like cosine similarity, OpenAI&#x27;s API to generate embeddings and the final comment in the issue thread, I also used GitHub&#x27;s REST API to fetch issues and comments.<p>It&#x27;s not perfect – no bot ever is – but it&#x27;s a start. I&#x27;m curious to hear what you think, and I&#x27;d love to hear about your own experiences with duplicate issues. What challenges have you faced? What solutions have you tried?

It moved files around, (after confirming that I agreed), it asked me some necessary questions and read Python files to derive dependencies for the pyproject file.<p>- I asked it to find and successively open a bunch of spreadsheets for me from different places, so I could do some edits and print each of them to a PDF.

And while the AI ecosystem is flourishing with a wide range of models, the current providers like ChatGPT, Bard or Copilot are creating closed environments that limit interactions to their owned models only.<p>We envision a future where AI is interoperable, and where people will choose the pick best model for their job. We are building Joia to make this freedom of choice a reality, offering an open-source product that is easy to use, organizations-ready and built for collaboration.<p>Features of Our Beta Version:<p>User Management: Easily provide user access to LLMs by adding them to a collaborative workspace.<p>Multi-LLM Access: Interact smoothly with models like GPT-4, Llama 2, Mixtral, Zephyr, Perplexity, Gemini, and others. More to be added soon.<p>Reusable Chatbots: Create pre-configured chatbots (also known as GPTs within the OpenAI ecosystem) and share them with your teammates.<p>Bring Your Own API Keys: Connect directly with the LLM provider of your choice by simply inserting their API keys. We currently support OpenAI, Openrouter, and Amazon Bedrock; with more to come soon.<p>Purchase Credits with Us and Consolidate Payments: In our cloud version, you can buy credits and centralize the billing for all users in the organization.<p>Open Source License: We offer the software under the Affero license, allowing anyone to self-host the platform.<p>We&#x27;re still in the early stages and eagerly welcome your feedback and suggestions.

Sharing keys among users risks leaking the key and makes it difficult to curb the leakage without interruptions. But assigning one key per user per cloud API results in too many keys to keep track of.<p>Meet LlaMa(ster)Key, the secure and easy solution for API key management:  * For each user, one master key for multiple APIs. * The master key is unique to each user. Granting and revoking a user&#x27;s access won&#x27;t impact other users.  * The actual API keys to authenticate with cloud APIs are never known to users. Never leak a key due to a careless intern. * No code change! Keep using the official Python SDK of the cloud AI APIs, including OpenAI, Cohere, AnyScale, Perplexity, HuggingFace (free-tier inference so far), and Vectara.<p>LlaMaKey works by taking advantage of the BASE_URL and API_KEY&#x2F;TOKEN environment variables that the official Python SDKs of major LLM&#x2F;GenAI APIs rely on.

The only solution is to read every message (or a sample) to get a sense of what is going on. You can&#x27;t improve your product without understanding who your users are and how they are using it. Nobody would launch a website without standard analytics today; the same principle should apply to LLM products.<p>We made phospho to analyze the large amounts of text from user inputs and LLM app outputs, and give you quantified and actionable insights.<p>You first log messages and set up semantic events. Eg: “user is talking about sports”, “assistant didn’t quote the source”. We then run asynchronous jobs to detect if events are present in the text or not. To do so, we use GPT-4 for the first few events, and then downsize to smaller fine-tuned models (cheaper &amp; faster). It works with any LLM provider (OpenAI, Mistral, Ollama…). No proxy, no monkey patch, and no OpenAI key needed.<p>You can link phospho to your users’ feedback, and even use the platform to annotate some messages yourself. This helps you design step by step a custom evaluation pipeline that runs automatically, fits your needs, and enables you to iterate.<p>Results are available in dashboards, as dataframes, or via API. You can also directly leverage the events in your app to trigger actions in real-time with the API or via webhooks.<p>Deploy everything with Docker, or use the hosted cloud version. We have Python&#x2F;Javascript SDK and an API.

In the hope of reducing this pain for others in the future, we’re working on automating debugging.<p>We’re currently working on a platform that ingests logs and then automatically reproduces, root causes and ultimately fixes production bugs as they happen. You can see some of our work on this here - <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39528087"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39528087</a><p>As we were building the root-cause phase of our automated debugger, we realized that we developed something that resembled an omniscient debugger. Like an omniscient debugger, it also keeps track of variable assignments over time but, you can interact with it at a higher level than a debugger using natural language. We ended up sticking it in a pytest plugin and have been using it ourselves for development over the past few weeks.<p>Using this pytest plugin, you’re able to reason at a much higher level than conventional debuggers and can ask questions like:<p>- Why did function x get hit?<p>- Why was variable y set to this value?<p>- What changes can I make to this code to make this test pass?<p>Here’s a brief demo of this in action: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;94ebe34097a343c39876d7109f2a1428"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;94ebe34097a343c39876d7109f2a1428</a><p>To achieve this, we first instrument the test using sys.settrace (or, on versions of python &gt;3.12, the far better sys.monitoring!) to keep a history of all the functions that were called, along with the calling line numbers. We then re-run the test and use AST parsing to find all the variable assignments and keep track of those changes over time. We also use AST parsing to obtain the source code for these functions. We then neatly format and pass all this context to GPT.<p>We’d love it if you checked the pytest plugin out and we welcome all feedback :) .

shuss,,39837654,25,"Hello HN!<p>One of the most common uses of LLMs is to go beyond what traditional RPA or IDP can do when it comes to structuring unstructured documents. However, there are a lot of challenges in getting this done right from extraction of text data from PDFs, scanned images or other formats, prompt engineering, evaluation and integration with existing systems. This very specific use case is where Unstract can help teams move really fast, leveraging LLMs. By doing the heavy-lifting in this fast-changing ecosystem it lets engineers concentrate on implementing core business workflow automations.<p>Here&#x27;s what&#x27;s special about Unstract:<p>AGPL-licensed: Unstract is available under the AGPL, which is friendly for personal or commercial use. Getting started is simply a matter of running a script, which should take care of everything leveraging Docker Compose. We&#x27;ve also made is very easy to update the container images should you wish to. If you have a Mac or a Linux laptop, you can get started in minutes.<p>LLMWhisperer: Results from LLMs are as good as the input they receive. LLMWhisperer is a cloud service that given PDFs (native text, scanned) returns text data in a way LLMs are best able to &quot;understand&quot;. LLMWhisperer is free for up to 100 pages a day. While Unstract supports LLMWhisperer, we&#x27;re also adding support for unstructured.io and LlamaParse as well (they&#x27;re both great services!). For more details: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;llmwhisperer.unstract.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;llmwhisperer.unstract.com</a><p>Strong, improving ecosystem support: Unstract supports a variety of providers for LLMs, Vector Databases, Embeddings, Cloud File Storage systems and databases&#x2F;data warehouses. A full list is available on our Github page (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Zipstack&#x2F;unstract"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Zipstack&#x2F;unstract</a>).<p>No-code Prompt Studio: You need a way to figure out how well your prompts are working for a set of documents to make sure the prompts you&#x27;re writing are as generic as possible. This is not easy to do with a regular IDE and a file manager on your laptop. Prompt Studio a purpose-built, no-code environment that makes it easy for you to develop, run and debug prompts while referring to sample documents side-by-side. The whole project is stored as a YAML (export&#x2F;import options coming soon).<p>Easy integrations: Unstract supports the launching of APIs and ETL Pipelines that take in unstructured documents and produce JSON data or sync data with various data sources like Snowflake, Bigquery, Redshift, PostgreSQL, etc. Prompt Studio no-code projects can be launched as APIs or ETL Pipelines with ease in just minutes letting you leverage LLMs to solve business automation problems. Unstructured data APIs are useful when an existing application needs to automate the processing of unstructured docs. Unstructured data ETL Pipelines are useful when unstructured docs in cloud file or object stores need to be structured and pushed into databases or data warehouses.<p>Quick start: See our documentation (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.unstract.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.unstract.com</a>) to walk through a quick start project structuring standard credit card statements from a couple of different banks. You can also view a 3-min video of Unstract here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=8aZh-pRwZh8"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=8aZh-pRwZh8</a><p>Enterprise-only features: Unstract has a couple of enterprise&#x2F;cloud&#x2F;managed features that are not part of the open source offering: LLMEval uses more than one LLM to arrive at a consensus on extracted fields. If there is no consensus, the field is set to null (a null value is always better than a wrong value), after which a human can review the extraction results. There are a couple of advanced Prompt Studio features that can cut token usage (and thus costs) by up to 6x (Single Pass and Summary-based Extraction). Otherwise, all other features are available in our open source version.",1711538330,2024-03-27 11:18:50 UTC,Show HN: Unstract(AGPL) – Launch LLM-powered APIs to structure unstructured docs,story,https://github.com/Zipstack/unstract,27/3/2024 11:18,88,67,159,72,472,1158,451,303,360,643,448,431,161,126,105,215,157,210,10,5,9,9,17,66,18,17,18,17,18,19

Spice provides federated SQL query across databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.), data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, etc.) and data lakes (S3, MinIO, Databricks, etc.) with the ability to materialize remote datasets locally using in-memory Arrow, DuckDB, SQLite, or PostgreSQL.

luanxr2000,,39915941,2,"Hi guys, this is Ray Luan, founder and CEO of NewOaks AI. Today I am thrilled to announce a significant leap forward in our journey: the open sourcing of our chat bubble module for AI chatbot builder. This strategic move is more than an enhancement to the NewOaks AI platform; it&#x27;s a bold step towards democratizing AI technology and fostering a vibrant community of developers and innovators.<p>Why Open Source?<p>The decision to open source our chat bubble module stems from a deep-rooted belief in the power of collaboration and community-driven development. The conversational AI chatbot is a highly competitive business but yet mature enough to meet business owner&#x27;s needs. In order to make the chatbot technology more innovative and mature I plan to open source the code of AI chatbot by stages to involve more top notch developers to accelerate the process and make better AI product . Open source technology accelerates innovation, facilitates transparency, and builds a foundation of trust and cooperation that proprietary solutions simply cannot match. By opening our technology to the world, we&#x27;re inviting developers, designers, and AI enthusiasts to join us in shaping the future of conversational AI.<p>The Future Roadmap: Beyond the Chat Bubble Module<p>Our commitment to open source doesn&#x27;t stop with the chat bubble module. We have an ambitious roadmap that includes several key initiatives aimed at further enhancing the capabilities and reach of NewOaks AI.<p>1. Open-Sourcing the UI of Knowledge Base Management: To improve chat quality and facilitate easier management of conversational content, we plan to open source the UI of our knowledge base management system. This will allow for greater customization and efficiency in how knowledge is curated and utilized within our platform.<p>2. Chunking Knowledge Base: We&#x27;re exploring innovative ways to segment the knowledge base into manageable, contextually relevant &quot;chunks.&quot; This approach will enhance the chatbot&#x27;s ability to understand and retrieve information, leading to more accurate and helpful responses.<p>3. RAG Technique for Talking to Files and Websites: One of the most exciting developments on our roadmap is the implementation of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique. This will enable our chatbots to dynamically retrieve information from files and websites in real-time, providing users with up-to-date, accurate answers and significantly enhancing the conversational experience.<p>Join Us on This Exciting Journey<p>We invite you to join us on this journey. Whether you&#x27;re a developer interested in contributing to our projects, a business looking to leverage our technology, or simply an AI enthusiast eager to learn more, there&#x27;s a place for you in the NewOaks AI community.<p>Together, we can redefine the possibilities of conversational AI and build a future where technology understands us better than ever before.

danenania,,39918500,304,"Hey HN, I&#x27;m building Plandex (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plandex.ai"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plandex.ai</a>), an open source, terminal-based AI coding engine for complex tasks.<p>I built Plandex because I was tired of copying and pasting code back and forth between ChatGPT and my projects. It can complete tasks that span multiple files and require many steps. It uses the OpenAI API with your API key (support for other models, including Claude, Gemini, and open source models is on the roadmap). You can watch a 2 minute demo here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;player.vimeo.com&#x2F;video&#x2F;926634577"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;player.vimeo.com&#x2F;video&#x2F;926634577</a><p>Here&#x27;s a prompt I used to build the AWS infrastructure for Plandex Cloud (Plandex can be self-hosted or cloud-hosted): <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;plandex-ai&#x2F;plandex&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;test&#x2F;test_prompts&#x2F;aws-infra.txt"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;plandex-ai&#x2F;plandex&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;test&#x2F;test_pr...</a><p>Something I think sets Plandex apart is a focus on working around bad outputs and iterating on tasks systematically. It&#x27;s relatively easy to make a great looking demo for any tool, but the day-to-day of working with it has a lot more to do with how it handles edge cases and failures. Plandex tries to tighten the feedback loop between developer and LLM:<p>- Every aspect of a Plandex plan is version-controlled, from the context to the conversation itself to model settings. As soon as things start to go off the rails, you can use the `plandex rewind` command to back up and add more context or iterate on the prompt. Git-style branches allow you to test and compare multiple approaches.<p>- As a plan proceeds, tentative updates are accumulated in a protected sandbox (also version-controlled), preventing any wayward edits to your project files.<p>- The `plandex changes` command opens a diff review TUI that lets you review pending changes side-by-side like the GitHub PR review UI. Just hit the &#x27;r&#x27; key to reject any change that doesn’t look right. Once you’re satisfied, either press ctrl+a from the changes TUI or run `plandex apply` to apply the changes.<p>- If you work on files you’ve loaded into context outside of Plandex, your changes are pulled in automatically so that the model always uses the latest state of your project.<p>Plandex makes it easy to load files and directories in the terminal. You can load multiple paths:<p><pre><code>  plandex load components&#x2F;some-component.ts lib&#x2F;api.ts ..&#x2F;sibling-dir&#x2F;another-file.ts </code></pre> You can load entire directories recursively:<p><pre><code>  plandex load src&#x2F;lib -r </code></pre> You can use glob patterns:<p><pre><code>  plandex load src&#x2F;**&#x2F;*.{ts,tsx} </code></pre> You can load directory layouts (file names only):<p><pre><code>  plandex load src --tree  </code></pre> Text content of urls:<p><pre><code>  plandex load https:&#x2F;&#x2F;react.dev&#x2F;reference&#x2F;react&#x2F;hooks </code></pre> Or pipe data in:<p><pre><code>  cargo test | plandex load </code></pre> For sending prompts, you can pass in a file:<p><pre><code>  plandex tell -f &quot;prompts&#x2F;stripe&#x2F;add-webhooks.txt&quot; </code></pre> Or you can pop up vim and write your prompt there:<p><pre><code>  plandex tell </code></pre> For shorter prompts you can pass them inline:<p><pre><code>  plandex tell &quot;set the header&#x27;s background to #222 and text to white&quot; </code></pre> You can run tasks in the background:<p><pre><code>  plandex tell &quot;write tests for all functions in lib&#x2F;math&#x2F;math.go. put them in lib&#x2F;math_tests.&quot; --bg  </code></pre> You can list all running or recently finished tasks:<p><pre><code>  plandex ps </code></pre> And connect to any running task to start streaming it:<p><pre><code>  plandex connect </code></pre> For more details, here’s a quick overview of commands and functionality: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;plandex-ai&#x2F;plandex&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;guides&#x2F;USAGE.md"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;plandex-ai&#x2F;plandex&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;guides&#x2F;USAGE...</a><p>Plandex is written in Go and is statically compiled, so it runs from a single small binary with no dependencies on any package managers or language runtimes. There’s a 1-line quick install:<p><pre><code>  curl -sL https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plandex.ai&#x2F;install.sh | bash </code></pre> It&#x27;s early days, but Plandex is working well and is legitimately the tool I reach for first when I want to do something that is too large or complex for ChatGPT or GH Copilot. I would love to get your feedback.

The toolkit also allows you to run ablation studies across LLMs, prompt designs, training configurations, and can ingest different data files -- all through just ONE YAML file! After fine-tuning, you can also run a bunch of tests to ensure that the fine-tuned LLM behaves as expected, enabling faster time-to-production!<p>Why this toolkit? Why now?<p>While closed-source LLMs have become popular for chat-based applications, enterprises are considering a shift to self-hosted SLMs (smaller language models) since there is evidence that you don&#x27;t need a gigantic model to solve narrow edge-cases. Plus, enterprises want to own the data pipeline from start to end, i.e., data ingestion, training, deployment, feedback collection and testing! Their customers&#x27; valuable data stays within their ecosystem, allowing enterprises to not worry about compliance or data leakage issues that come up using third-party APIs.<p>While there are a few repositories out there that do vanilla fine-tuning, it is well known that it takes more than a one run to find the desirable setting of weights &#x2F; parameters for your specific data. Bearing this pain-point in mind, we designed the toolkit to allow running multiple experiments through one config file!<p>Around 5 months ago, I had shared a repository that contained individual fine-tuning scripts for the most popular LLMs. While the repository received great reception from this community, there was one unanimous feedback -- the community wants to build on top of our scripts!

So, I decided to compare GPT and Claude&#x27;s performance in using different tools for tasks like web scraping and browser automation.<p>Learnings:<p>- AI agents still work best for simple, well-constrained tasks.<p>- To create a successful agent, you need to provide it with good tools. The LLM can then figure out the correct sequence of tool calls itself, which feel like a promising direction.<p>- Tool use is still quite slow and often very expensive. I&#x27;ve spend around $50 just on experimenting with Claude for one day. Imagine what the testing would cost for a production-scale system.

We failed to make it work, however, we realized the importance of shortcuts when trying to get more users with limited resources.<p>Localization always seemed like such a shortcut: we felt we could’ve onboarded many more international customers who sign up but end up leaving because they couldn’t use them in their native language.<p>However, it really bothered us how much effort we needed to put into setting up localization using react-intl&#x2F;lingui&#x2F;react-i18next. It was annoying to extract translatable text from the code and then maintain translation dictionaries. We were also constantly prompt-engineering ChatGPT to produce accurate translations.<p>We made Replexica to automatically traverse React code and understand what needs translation, removing the need to extract strings from the code. That means, you don’t spend time maintaining JSON dictionaries and just focus on shipping features. You just need to plug in Replexica Compiler.<p>We’ve bundled Replexica API with a combination of several LLMs, to produce great translations. We’re using a prompt-engineered GPT-4 to extract the context of the product (e.g., from its website) and the “brand voice”. We’re also using a combination of Llama&#x2F;GPT&#x2F;Mixtral for translation. Also, the API spec is open, meaning every developer can build their own translation engine and self-host it.<p>Replexica works seamlessly with Next.js App Router. We’re considering adding support for Next.js Pages Router and Remix.js next. We’d love to hear your feature requests!<p>We opened our repo under the MIT license last week and launched the API. The goal is to not charge hobby and open-source projects. We make money by charging for higher usage volume and enterprise features like user permissions and support.<p>Give it a spin: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;replexica&#x2F;replexica"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;replexica&#x2F;replexica</a>.

The strong typing helps us identify the breaking changes with a version bump pretty well. We can then pass the type errors into the LLM to increase its fix accuracy.<p>Challenge [3] is definitely the trickiest. We built an AST of the codebase that we then use to create a “plan graph” (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;huggingface.co&#x2F;papers&#x2F;2309.12499"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;huggingface.co&#x2F;papers&#x2F;2309.12499</a>) of the type error, the function it’s used in, and the functions calling it. This plan graph should tell us how a fix would need to be perpetuated throughout the codebase.<p>At a high level bumpgen’s core loop is something like this:<p>- build an AST to understand your code’s relationships<p>- bump version and get type errors<p>- combine the above to create a plan graph (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;huggingface.co&#x2F;papers&#x2F;2309.12499"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;huggingface.co&#x2F;papers&#x2F;2309.12499</a>) of how to fix the error and apply it to the rest of the codebase<p>- prompt the LLM to step through the plan graph and fix each breaking change<p>- validate the fixes with a rebuild<p>We also built our own benchmark suite (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;xeol-io&#x2F;swe-bump-bench"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;xeol-io&#x2F;swe-bump-bench</a>) to test bumpgen’s accuracy. It is a set of repos with human commits for version bumps. We would run bumpgen on the prior commit then compare bumpgen’s PR to that of the human commit to determine success. Our latest benchmark sits around ~50% accuracy.<p>Up next we want to better address challenge [2] by building embeddings for different dependency versions to give the LLM more context on the changes across versions. After that we will be releasing a GitHub app with some qol features such as configuring update cadences, etc before moving onto C# and Golang support.<p>We covered a lot of our architecture and thought process for bumpgen, we would love to hear your thoughts and feedback in the comments!",1714487704,2024-04-30 14:35:04 UTC,Show HN: Bumpgen – upgrade NPM packages using AI,story,https://github.com/xeol-io/bumpgen,30/4/2024 14:35,41,4,6,4,3,3,82,0,0,0,0,0,51,12,15,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,4,1,1,1,0,0

ashvardanian,,40249546,6,"I was recently playing with Apple&#x27;s CoreML and had several painful observations on tooling. It&#x27;s not enough for a long read but should be for an HN post.<p>In short, you can take a simple BERT-like encoder model in PyTorch, convert it into an f32 CoreML checkpoint, and run it on CPU or GPU, but not NPU. Let&#x27;s unpack this.<p>Having a simple and extensible format to exchange common ANN architectures is a big issue for anyone who uses more than one framework or programming language to run the same model. ONNX is the closest we have to that standard, but it&#x27;s hard to call anything Protobuf-related &quot;simple.&quot; If you start with ONNX, you quickly realize - Apple has no tool for converting ONNX-&gt;CoreML. But if you want to go ONNX-&gt;PyTorch-&gt;CoreML, be warned that PyTorch has no ONNX import functionality. (issue #21683).<p>When you convert to CoreML, you can choose the `precision`. Evaluating modern models in full precision seems wasteful, so I&#x27;ve used half-precision variants over single precision. Unlike ONNX, with CoreML, you can&#x27;t get to data types under 16 bits in size. 16-bit variants also didn&#x27;t work for me, so UForm is currently stuck with 32 bits. This means our iOS-targeting checkpoints are heavier than PyTorch, SafeTensor, and ONNX exports of the same model (bf16, bf16, and u8, respectively).<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;huggingface.co&#x2F;unum-cloud&#x2F;uform3-image-text-english-small&#x2F;tree&#x2F;main"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;huggingface.co&#x2F;unum-cloud&#x2F;uform3-image-text-english-...</a><p>CoreML tooling allows you to specify the `RangeDim`, marking the variable-length sides of the input tensor. This is handy if you want to support different batch sizes. ONNX has that functionality and works fine, while CoreML fails. So, for now, I stick to batch size one.<p>Last, Xcode provides a profiler to measure your models&#x27; latency&#x2F;throughput. The profiler covers CPUs, GPUs, and NPUs, but no model I&#x27;ve tested could run on the NPU. I assume those are reserved for first-party models. Interestingly, Apple Silicon contains specialized AMX (Advanced Matrix eXtensions) clusters near Macs&#x27; performance and efficiency cores. Those differ from Intel&#x27;s AMX (Advanced Matrix eXtensions) and Arm&#x27;s SME (Scalable Matrix Extensions). They aren&#x27;t publicly documented, but their whole purpose is AI acceleration. If I run the inference on the CPU - it&#x27;s 10x slower than on the GPU on M2 Pro, so AMX is probably not used. It would be great to get clarifications from Apple on the purpose of all those specialized enclaves.<p>---<p>Model aside, there are a lot of other issues with the developer experience.<p>Let&#x27;s address the Xcode in the room. I mostly write code using VS Code. When it gets too slow and buggy, I switch to the native Sublime Text. In the Apple ecosystem, you are lost without a good second option once Xcode fails.<p>The most common issues I&#x27;ve faced were adding&#x2F;updating&#x2F;removing app dependencies. Another big one is running a build and wondering if it&#x27;s the latest or some internal cached version. When something breaks, you must navigate Plist (XML) files to clean up the mess. That&#x27;s similar to manually editing the `yarn.lock` or `poetry.lock` if you are coming from JS or Python.<p>One of VS Code&#x27;s handiest features is &quot;Format on Save.&quot; Keeping the code sane is necessary for popular open-source projects. Xcode has no such feature. Apple has a first-party tool called `swift-format`, which uses the `.swift-format` config. Xcode doesn&#x27;t respect that config. Moreover, I couldn&#x27;t make the `swift-format` tool mimic the native Xcode style for empty lines.<p>Last, I needed help finding a way to use Sphinx for Swift and Objective-C documentation. Generating API references for projects with many language bindings is extremely hard, and Swift isn&#x27;t making it more accessible.<p>---<p>Overall, Apple ships some fantastic hardware, but we are in the very early days of software adoption, and I hope these notes help the company patch some rough corners before the WWDC.",1714754129,2024-05-03 16:35:29 UTC,Show HN: Swift-powered AI apps on iOS: Real-time multimodal semantic search,story,https://github.com/ashvardanian/SwiftSemanticSearch,3/5/2024 16:35,6,5,5,14,3,3,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0
