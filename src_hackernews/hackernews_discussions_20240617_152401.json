Based on reported revenue at cohere of 20 MM - I think it&#x27;s a fair assumption that the only other material revenue in the industry is in the applications side either at megacaps or smaller startups targeting various back office tasks.<p>One could make a bearish claim on NVidia, that their revenue&#x2F;valuation is unsustainable unless the AI industry grows 100x over the next few years.",

But <i>any</i> policy on this matter will have real limitations and trade-offs, and the current one is no exception.

            "I&#x27;ve made a decent chunk of edits especially in the area of reliable sources, so I might as well extend on what the article is saying.<p>First off, Wikipedia is pseudonymous. You can&#x27;t cite yourself because anyone could easily claim to be a domain expert and lie.[1] Rather than verify credentials, it&#x27;s generally expected that content be cited to a reliable source other than the user.<p>And it&#x27;s also not just about being a domain expert, because experts frequently disagree. The ideal source isn&#x27;t &quot;domain expert says x&quot;,[2] it&#x27;s &quot;academic article says major views in domain include x,y,z&quot;.[3] The goal of this isn&#x27;t to entrench a cabal, it&#x27;s to ensure that Wikipedia doesn&#x27;t spotlight fringe perspectives only seen by a few experts in a field. So, re; &quot;Wikipedia specifically rejects domain experts until someone who knows nothing cites them elsewhere&quot;, that&#x27;s a feature and not a bug.<p>Anyways, to add some more context, Wikipedia has a big problem with people citing their own content to boost SEO.[4][5] Even academics publishing peer-reviewed content do this because Wikipedia cites are now a tracked metric. I can&#x27;t verify whether that&#x27;s what happened in the original blogpost. But the average editor seeing someone that isn&#x27;t very active come on and repeatedly cite a single book is going to get alarm bells in their head.<p>About citing a company on itself, I wrote a lengthy comment on that below.[6]<p>Probably the single piece of advice I&#x27;d give to someone wanting to edit Wikipedia is to understand that someone reverting your edit is supposed to start a discussion, not end one. This is called the &quot;bold, revert, discuss cycle&quot;.[7] You&#x27;re entitled to ask for reasons why your edit is reverted, and if you can&#x27;t reach an agreement, you can get input from other people in the community. The main place for discussing whether a source is reliable is the reliable sources noticeboard,[8] but you can also get help editing at the Teahouse.[9]<p>Also, if you&#x27;re a grieving widow trying to get your husband&#x27;s article updated, I would recommend contacting the volunteer response team at info-en-o@wikimedia.org. This is a private email (instead of the publicly visible Teahouse), one of the purposes of which is to help people who are the subjects of articles to get errors about themselves fixed.[10] You can also use photosubmission@wikimedia.org to submit photos of yourself for articles.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Essjay_controversy\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Essjay_controversy</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wikipedia:Verifiability#Self-published_sources\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wikipedia:Verifiability#Self-p...</a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wikipedia:No_original_research#Secondary\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wikipedia:No_original_research...</a><p>[4] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wikipedia:Conflict_of_interest#Citing_yourself\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wikipedia:Conflict_of_interest...</a><p>[5] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Special:Search?fulltext=Search&amp;fulltext=Search&amp;prefix=Wikipedia%3AConflict+of+interest%2FNoticeboard%2F&amp;search=selfcite&amp;ns0=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Special:Search?fulltext=Search...</a><p>[6] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=40698952#40701045\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=40698952#40701045</a><p>[7] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wikipedia:BOLD,_revert,_discuss_cycle\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wikipedia:BOLD,_revert,_discus...</a><p>[8] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wikipedia:Reliable_sources&#x2F;Noticeboard\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wikipedia:Reliable_sources&#x2F;Not...</a><p>[9] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wikipedia:Teahouse\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wikipedia:Teahouse</a><p>[10] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wikipedia:Volunteer_Response_Team\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wikipedia:Volunteer_Response_T...</a>",

(Each side could offer whatever arguments and evidence it wanted.)<p>This would solve the huge problem with crypto currencies that there is no repudiation for fraudulent transactions (they can&#x27;t be reversed if they turn out to be fraudulent.) But an AI can&#x27;t actually do this and back up a currency with a dispute process around it, that&#x27;s why it isn&#x27;t being done.<p>Here I roleplay a dispute between a merchant and a buyer:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chatgpt.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;6a420d3f-9469-4234-8283-6daf18e90b12\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chatgpt.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;6a420d3f-9469-4234-8283-6daf18e90b...</a><p>As you can see, it finds in favor of the person who wants to reverse the charge, but this means the buyer can just rip off any business, get anything they want for free and literally never pay for anything by just reversing every transaction.  What the AI judge should have done is look at the total amount of business that the business does and whether it has any other disputes, because if the total amount of business is high without any disputes then it is a legitimate business, but if everyone is disputing it or it tried to inflate its ratings with a bunch of low-value items and then shipped rocks instead of a high-value item then it is a scam merchant.  Besides this, changes of ownership also matter (a scam merchant who will ship rocks can buy an existing long-standing merchant for their credibility).<p>Overall, a blanket reversal without looking at the merchant to verify that it is fraudulent is not really good adjudication in my opinion and if the AI were judging all these cases then consumers could just defraud every business and no business would use that form of payment and dispute process since consumers would abuse it to get everything for free.<p>This shows that AI really isn&#x27;t ready to adjudicate real cases, and this case is far simpler than cases that make it to the Supreme Court."

            "A lot of people here haven&#x27;t integrated GPT into a customer facing production system, and it shows<p>gpt-4, gpt-4-turbo, and gpt-4o are not the same models. They are mostly close enough when you have a human in the loop, and loose constraints. But if you are building systems off of the (already fragile) prompt based output, you will have to go through a very manual process of tuning your prompts to get the same&#x2F;similar output out of the new model. It will break in weird ways that makes you feel like you are trying to nail Jello to a tree<p>There are software tools&#x2F;services that help with this, and a ton more that merely promise to, but most of the tooling around LLMs these days gives the illusion of a reliable tool rather than results of one. It&#x27;s the early days of the gold rush still, and every one wants to be seen as one of the first",
            "One of the decent parts about open weights models is that you can&#x27;t have this happen to you. You get to keep access to any model you want. This is essential for continuity of products.",
            "Looks like they are just cleaning house of lesser-used models? This came via mail last week.<p><pre><code>  Back in June 2023 and November 2023, we announced the following models will be deprecated on June 13th, 2024:\n   gpt-3.5-turbo-0301 \n   gpt-3.5-turbo-0613\n   gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613\n  We noticed that your organization recently used at least one of these models. To help minimize any disruption, we are extending your access to these models for an additional 3 month grace period until September 13th, 2024. After this date, these models will be fully decommissioned.</code></pre>",
            "So much for code migrations! Although most examples are about summarization or needle in a haystack search, applications whose output should be the size of input are probably more important although less advertised.<p>Curious if that is a business decision or a technical decision aka if optimizations for cheap and fast 128k gpt4o work only for small outputs",
            "I&#x27;m confused here. What&#x27;s an &quot;output context&quot;? My assumption was that the context window was shared across input and (prior) output. You put everything into the model at once, and then at the end the first unused context vector becomes a vector you can decode for a single token of output. With multiple token output meaning you repeatedly inference, decode, sample, append, and repeat until you sample an end token. Is this just a limit of OpenAI APIs or something I&#x27;m forgetting?",
            "I am having trouble understanding what the complaint is here.<p>The docs still mention bigger models with 128k tokens and smaller models with 8k tokens. It seems reasonable to optimize for big and small use cases differently? I don&#x27;t see how we are being &quot;robbed&quot;.",
            "Ah I see, taking a page from the Google playbook and aggressively culling less popular products. I wonder how many sales Google&#x27;s reputation for capricious culling has cost them."
